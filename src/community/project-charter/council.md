## What is the council?

Initial definition: The council is the founding group who act as trustess for the community to uphold the ADempiere objectives. In short they work together to foster the community and the development of Adempiere, and represent and promote the ADempiere objectives globally.

According to this new definition [1](https://sourceforge.net/p/adempiere/discussion/611167/thread/b88fbe44/) council is just a museum piece with a founding fathers' status and not be looked upon as active or managerial.
