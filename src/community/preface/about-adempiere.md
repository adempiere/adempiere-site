## About ADempiere
The ADempiere project was created in September 2006 after a long running disagreement between [ComPiere Inc.](https://wiki.adempiere.net/Difference_With_Compiere), the developers of Compiere™, and the community that formed around that project. The community believed Compiere Inc. placed too much emphasis on the open source lock-in/commercial nature of the project, rather than the community sharing/enriching nature of the project, and after an impassioned discussion decided to split from Compiere™ giving birth to the ADempiere project.

## ADempiere - Where Did It Come From?
The name was first suggested during the Forking Debate by Carlos Ruiz. Its meanings was finally rendered onto the site as part of our declaration, which was written by Colin Rooney in Wikipedia.

The project name comes from the Italian word meaning 'to fulfill' but with additional context of "to complete, reach, practice, perform the duties of, or free (discharge), it also means to honor and respect", which was felt was very appropriate to what the project wished to achieve.

The ADempiere name was highly applauded by the community. Matt Asay interestingly commented it as 'lame' in infoworld blog. He has since then written personally to Reduan apologizing and even gave further airtime with more entries such as right to fork and rightfully innovative.
