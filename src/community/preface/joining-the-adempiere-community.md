If you are reading this, you are already part of our community.

ADempiere is a open-source project using [commons-based peer-production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production) methods. Organized as a bazaar of [Citizens](../citizens/README.md), the project is governed by [Technical](a), [Functional](a) and [Community Council Teams](../community-council-team/README.md). The intellectual property of the community is protected by the ADempiere Foundation, a non-profit group which provides legal and financial support to the community.

The project follows a Open Source philosophy with a 3-line principle of:

- [Information Is Free](a)
- [People Are Not](a)
- [Contributors Are Priceless](a)
