This tutorial will show you how to customize the ADempiere core software without making changes to the ADempiere project directly. Customization changes are instead included in customization.jar and zkcustomization.jar which can be deployed in the ADempiere install.

## Introduction

Sometimes you realize that ADempiere does not perfectly suit your needs and you need to make some changes to parts of the source code. Some customizations are not possible to achieve through ADempiereâ€™s brilliant [Application Dictionary](a) and you have to modify the source code for that. The recommended way of customizing the software is to do it in a separate project. There you can create your customized classes and generate the customization jar archives.

## How to setup up your environment
You will need to have two projects in your development environment: one for the ADempiere project and one for your customized code that will depend on the ADempiere project.

## Create the ADempiere Project

1. If you haven't already done so, follow the [ADempiere Version Control](./adempiere-version-control.md) process to checkout a branch of the ADempiere project.
2. [Create your ADempiere development environment](./create-your-adempiere-development-environment.md) and, if you are modifying the zk interface, [Creating WebUI Workspace using Eclipse Webtool](./creating-webui-workspace-using-eclipse-webtool.md)
3. Build (using utils_dev/build.xml), install, setup the software (to create the .properties file) and import the database seed.
4. Modify the launch configurations as required and test that you can run the client and zk interfaces.
5. You now have the main ADempiere project created. Changes to this project should be made as part of the [Software Development Procedure](./software-development-procedure.md) to fix bugs, add features and generate common code that will be shared by all ADempiere implementations.
