The great thing about [Open Source ERP](http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Open_Source_ERP) is that you can extend it. This is part of the overall course on [Adempiere Technical Training](http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Adempiere_Technical_Training).
Note that the spelling for ADempiere in the title is proper as it is defined [here](http://www.adempiere.com/wiki/).
