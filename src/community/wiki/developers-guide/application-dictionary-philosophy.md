The idea behing Application Dictionary is to consolidate the common Unser Interface behaviors of ERP system to a set of metadata tools such as Tables, Windows, Menu, Reports, Forms, Validation Rules, Messages and Fields. All the User Interface activites are done using AD Windows. Adempiere brings you the power of managing all these UI components very easily using its Application Dictionary interface with zero coding.

You can easily create a new AD Window from adempiere . A window is backed up with one or more database tables. The common facilities such as create, delete, modify and search its contents (records) are abstracted inside a Window. Adempiere brings it by default when you create a new window.
