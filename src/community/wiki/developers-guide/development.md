### Advance Topic

- [How to create a complete new module in ADempiere](https://wiki.adempiere.net/How_to_create_a_complete_new_module_in_ADempiere)

## Quick Links

### Extention Framework

Extension mechanism in ADempiere is composed of [Callouts](a), [Model Validators](a), [Java Triggers](a), [Processes](a), [Views](a) and [Reports](a),[Rules](a) & [Scripts](a), [Forms](a) , [Print Formats](a) ,Import File Loader. A detailed discussion on such items can be found in [wikiversity document](a).

### Developers Guide

The [Developers Guide](http://sourceforge.net/projects/adempiere/files/Documentation/All%20Documents/DeveloperGuide.pdf/download) explains in very detailed manner classes and processes. A must if you are interested in developing or knowing how ADempiere actually works.

### Prototype Applications

[E-ticketing](https://wiki.adempiere.net/E-ticketing) is a proof-of-concept done by [user:Red1](https://wiki.adempiere.net/User:Red1) and his team. It covers Sales Order and e-Ticketing for Express Bus service between cities.

### Prerequisites for Developers

You have to have [these competencies](a) before you seriously start ADempiere development

### Debugging

- [Debugging Adempiere](a). • See these slides on Debugging using Eclipse [[2]](http://adempiere.com/images/c/c3/Debugging_ADempiere_By_Nasir.pdf).• [ZK WebUI Debugging using Eclipse](a)

### Report Developers

Good set of information on [BIRT](http://www.eclipse.org/birt/) and [Jasper Report](http://jasperforge.org/projects/jasperreports). Classes and APIs used for Reporting [[3]](http://www.adempiere.com/images/0/04/ADempiere_Reporting.pdf)

### Prepare Your Environment

This article "[Create your ADempiere development environment](./create-your-adempiere-development-environment.md)" discuss on preparing the development environment for Adempiere .For Eclipse [[1]](http://adempiere.com/index.php/Image:New_Project_InEclips.pdf) & for Netbeans [Development using Netbeans](a).

### Exenstion Framework Concepts

[ADempiere Rapid Development](./adempiere-rapid-development.md) covers the overall framework.[Software Business Model](a) describes the Business Model.[Nice article](a) from [user:Ijam_duo](https://wiki.adempiere.net/User:Ijam_duo) on [Data Replication](https://wiki.adempiere.net/User:Ijam_duo/data_replication)

## [Software Development](./software-development-procedure.md)

See [Software Development Procedure](./software-development-procedure.md) for developers and citizens. They should serve as a guideline on how to achieve the common goal of a high quality Open Source ERP System.

## Installation
There are two ways to get started with ADempiere, the first one is to go with the [ADempiere Virtual Appliance](a) which runs under the VMware player, this is a ready to use ADempiere prebuilt installation. This solution can be very convenient if you want to quickly evaluate ADempiere and don't want to be bothered with the intricacies and tuning of a whole new install.

If you are a power user, or if you want to hack ADempiere source code, you can go with a [whole new install](a).

## Creating your own development environment and contributing

ADempiere is an open source product, you can download the source code and start hacking, developing new functionalities, or correcting bugs. One of the best open source IDE out there is Eclipse. [Eclipse Setup](a) Show you how to create your own development environment in Eclipse and start your own development process.

Your contributions to ADempiere source code are of course welcome, ADempiere is a project entirely driven by its community. The [Hacker's guide](a) show you how you can start contributing, but remember first to sign the [Contributor agreement](a).

## The Active Data Dictionary and parametrization

One of the main stregnth of ADempiere, is the concept of Active Data Dictionary (ADD). ADmpiere Data Dictionary contains definitions of a data entity (type, validation, etc.), how it is displayed (label on screens and reports, help, display sequence and position relative to other fields), and the display rules. It also contains security and access rules. To make using the Dictionary more straightforward, all the columns in the same table have the same prefix, Table Prefix has a list of all the prefix used in ADempiere.

An important part of the adaption process of ADempiere to your specific needs is done by understanding the Active Dictionary Data model.

### Understanding which window is used to maintain a table

This information [here](a) is a good technical help, i.e. if you want to know which window is used to maintain a table, you can find that table on this document, it will also show you which is the corresponding maintenance window. Same if you want to find which window executes a process, you will find it and it will show the window/process/report.

## Changing the Look and Feel

You can adapt the ADempiere Look and Feel to your own needs, there are at least [two ways to do it](a).

## Data migration

[Sage Line 50](a) describes a data migration process.

## Localization

In order for ADempiere to be usable in any country, it needs to be adapted to the local language and accounting system, if you want to adapt ADempiere to your own language see [Localization Guide](a).

There are already many localized versions of ADempiere, please checke first with the ADempiere community, if the version you are looking for have not been already done.
