Goorvy is an agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine which makes modern programming features available to Java developers with almost-zero learning curve. It supports Domain-Specific Languages and other compact syntax so your code becomes easy to read and maintain. In Adempiere, it seamlessly integrates with all existing Java classes and libraries and compiles straight to Java bytecode so you can use it anywhere you can use Java

[BeanShell](http://www.beanshell.org/intro.html) is a small, free, embeddable Java source interpreter with object scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell dynamically executes standard Java syntax and extends it with common scripting conveniences such as loose types, commands, and method closures like those in Perl and JavaScript.
