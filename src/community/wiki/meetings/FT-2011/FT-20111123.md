## Log

~~~
Hello Emiliano,
hello all,

after preparing the topic about Credits in Java Code Header in "AdempiereIdGenerator.java" this morning, I had a chat with the following Functional- and Technical-Team Members this afternoon:

Mario Calderon
Teo Sarca
Victor Perez
Tobias Schöneberg
and me myself


The original Idea for this class comes fom ZK (Potix) themselves. The author was Ryan Wu. So we suggest to put him in the Header as Copyright Holder and in the lines of @author History at the top. Carlos Ruiz took his (and Heng Sin's, and Ivan Calderons, ...) idea and the code from ZK and built this class in ADempiere. So Carlos should be allowed to mention his name as second @author. Last significant change was made by Victor Perez. So her should mention his name in the last @author.

We suggest to solve this issue with the following code header:

 We would like to take the results of this discussion and use them as Rule/ Schema for future credit Descriptions in ADempiere Code too.
 
 What do you think?
 
 Let us know if we should take a look at further classes. 
 
 Greetings from Sankt Augustin.
 Mark
