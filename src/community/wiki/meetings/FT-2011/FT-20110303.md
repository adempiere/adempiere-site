## Agenda Items:

### 1. Mike McKay as New Functional Team Member:
- Mike McKay (Ottawa, Canada) was invited and presented himself as a new member.

### 2. ADempiere Server Test:
- A Virtual Server is already running on an Amazon server, set up by Victor.

- Adempiere eV will be approached to check for available space on the newly purchased server.

### 3. Testing Framework Evaluation Status:
- Functional team members evaluated three testing environments: Selenium, Fitnesse, and Sahi.
- Selenium: Issues with Adempiere ZK focus in Firefox, other browsers working fine.
