## Agenda: Organizing Test Towards Release

**Context:**
- Adempiere is installed on ADeV server ([http://46.4.135.113/webui/](http://46.4.135.113/webui/))
- It includes the latest bug fixes (Revision up to 6657).
- Jenkins is working. This means, every night a build from the latest revision is done.
- List of Bug Fixes: [Google Spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao75Xw0hxpT4dGM0SUpyb3ZsSW5FenhkQUxGRjdaOWc&hl=en_US)
- Includes Carlos' bug fixes and some other BFs from SFN.
- It does not include functionality like Cash Flow, Requests, Authorizations Work.

**Testing: General Information**
- The tests have to be done from line 454 up to the end in the Spreadsheet.
- Text of Bug fix to start with: Specify exactly which are the search fields. Implemented as discussed in the forum thread. Sponsored by Metas GmbH. Link to SF Tracker: [http://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=3016592](http://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=3016592)

**How to Test:**
- Bugs with a tracker: functionality can be read from the tracker.
- Bugs without a tracker: only a source diff can help for a text.
- Here a community member with access to sources should be involved.

**What to Test:**
- BFs are low impact.
- Only Daniel Tamm's changes and MySQL changes are of big impact.
- MySQL should pose no major problem; it only has to be tested.
- It was decided to concentrate just on BFs, not in testing MySQL nor Daniel Tamm's changes and leave them as "alpha," as long as they do not have a negative impact on Adempiere.
- Victor and Enrique will analyze Daniel's changes whether they are OK with Adempiere.
- They will write comments on Daniel Tamm's changes and publish them for discussion within the community.
- After that, it will be decided whether to keep them
