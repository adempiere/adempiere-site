[06:33:31] Victor Perez Juarez: is an feature of new cost engine
[06:34:36] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): we tested what Susanne had set up .. mainly tested average costing .. and it looked good to us.  but its a big topic and we need others to also test
[06:35:55] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): do you think you will hav time to disuss with Susanne this week .. assuming she has time..
[06:37:36] Victor Perez Juarez: byes because not understand about Earlier Transaction t

[06:44:01] Mario Calderón: and let's move on
[06:44:44] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I think they were the main outstanding items ... any others to raise?
[06:44:59] Victor Perez Juarez: Mario I see a lot of boilerpipe java code
[06:45:17] Victor Perez Juarez: and duplicate code , it no is good  we need improve :-)
[06:45:44] Victor Perez Juarez: I supouse that this work but is necessary clean

[06:47:10] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): anyone else who might be able to review it?
[06:47:30] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): big topic .. needs many eyes I think
[06:48:58] Victor Perez Juarez: so that we not answer of AdeV about of server , Paul and me setup a server that we to deployment
[06:49:04] Victor Perez Juarez: http://portal.nickelnetworks.com/web/adempiere-io/home
[06:49:13] Victor Perez Juarez: so we only need some domain
[06:49:17] Mario Calderón: thanks to Paul!
[06:49:24] Victor Perez Juarez: to redirect
[06:53:26] Victor Perez Juarez: other question we leave of sourceforge form to replace by http://www.liferay.com/es/documentation/liferay-portal/6.1/user-guide/-/ai/knowledge-base?
[06:53:57] Victor Perez Juarez: Ramiro saya me that we lost all we forum after of migration
[06:54:26] suman ravuri: @Victor, mainteance would be difficult
[06:54:38] suman ravuri: one of us has to maintain it
[06:55:58] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): moving off sourceforge (or not) seems unrelated to getting 380 finished .. can it be dealt with separately a a later date
[06:56:58] Victor Perez Juarez: I think that is important , because staring of testing and we need document this in some place
[06:57:27] Victor Perez Juarez: we need a platform for collaboration , create of test case and document of each new feature of 380
[06:58:16] Mario Calderón: ok

this can be tackled later

when are we going to give the go ahead to community testing?
[07:00:24] Victor Perez Juarez: @Mario we have a plan to testing ?
[07:01:24] Mario Calderón: not yet Victor
[07:01:40] Mario Calderón: we can do the same as last time
[07:01:58] Mario Calderón: to enumerate bugs and work them off
[07:03:06] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): well I suspect it starts shortly after we get the last bits of the code in place .. so ML and costing and WM must be the priority
[07:05:19] suman ravuri: @Victor, any tentative date?
[07:05:36] Mario Calderón: agree
[07:05:48] suman ravuri: ML I will finish this week
[07:05:54] Mario Calderón: but it would be OK if we set a date...
[07:07:48] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): so if ML is done this week then we are only left with WM and costing to deal with
[07:09:07] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): any other matters?
[07:09:31] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I need to go.. someone want to moderate?
[07:10:13] Mario Calderón: not from my side
[07:10:14] suman ravuri: I think we are done with agenda
[07:10:44] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): @Mario, what other points please
[07:11:03] Mario Calderón: not aymore, I believe...
