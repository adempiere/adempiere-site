[06:12:22] John Agudelo: ok
[06:13:20] Victor Perez Juarez: Then I think need integrate susanne work
[06:15:23] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I received an email from Susanne today with a report of of how her testing is going and with the code for  "CEValidator, which organizes the generation of entries in the table m_costdetail".  Is this the work you need to integrate or just part of it?
[06:15:30] Victor Perez Juarez: But first need undenrstan how work of changes
[06:16:58] Victor Perez Juarez: Yes this work because the model validaror delete a cost detail but when is generate again
[06:17:39] Victor Perez Juarez: I not understand
[06:17:47] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Is it sensible for Suman to incorporate what Susanne sent me so it can be tested?
[06:18:35] Mario Calderón: +1 from me, so others can test and find out how it works, just functionally
[06:18:43] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I ask because I dont know if what Susanne sent is all that Suman would need.
[06:19:16] Victor Perez Juarez: I not sure of changes are alot and have not some order
[06:20:13] Victor Perez Juarez: I try chat with susanne but i can not found
[06:20:22] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): we spent some time testing what Susanne made avaiable in a test instance and it seemed to be doing what made sense for an average costing system
[06:20:46] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): we did not test any other costing method at this stage.
[06:20:59] Mario Calderón: Thomas Krausse from Cibex (Austria) says the same
[06:21:27] Mario Calderón: but it has to be reviewd at code level by Victor...
[06:22:10] John Agudelo: I agreed with mario: +1 from me, so others can test and find out how it works, just functionally
[06:22:10] Mario Calderón: and correct anything which doesn't comply with ABP
[06:22:30] Victor Perez Juarez: Mario in my code i have patches that Susanne have not then i not sure that work completly
[06:22:59] Mario Calderón: that is what I mean: you review it and correct these patches
[06:23:32] Victor Perez Juarez: Yes on other hand i need complete code
[06:23:39] Mario Calderón: ok
[06:24:02] Victor Perez Juarez: Susanne send me but not have All dependences
[06:24:27] Victor Perez Juarez: I copy of code and have errors
[06:24:56] Mario Calderón: then: 

1. you talk to Susanne to get the complete code



2.- you put it in a way it can be commited, so others can test

[06:31:23] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): we have to bring this to a conclusion .. what are we going to do?
[06:32:40] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): we can take up what Victor provided with the changes from Susanne and put it out for testing .. or we can wait while Victor has a chance to review if Victor has time .. which shall it be?
