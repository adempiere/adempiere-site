- Horizontal tab is integrated in swing

**Misc**
- Problems with hg and git
- Mike's findings: on windows, the issue seemed to be Mercurial versions <= 2.7.1. The recent 2.7.2 version works well and has solved the issues.
- One can now update to pre git revisions and back to the tip without issues.
- Hasn't tried commits to the git repo yet.
- Mike can move around and update normally and the git is removed or added without issue.
- Suman tested and it works for him.
- Mike's recommendation: try the thg.exe version of TortoiseHG instead of the thgw.exe version. The former is working for me. (TortoiseHG version 2.9.2 with mercurial 2.7.2.)
- Configurable dashboards ([Configurable Dashboards Blog](http://blogs.walkingtree.in/2013/03/07/configurable-dashboards/)) will be added to RC
- ZK versions of delete entities, GL Reconciliation and prettying up the html reports will be added to RC
- Walking Tree's Human Resource enhancements on Libero HR would be a great addition, but too late for 380. Victor will see the possibility of integrating it and adding more functionality.

Problems with updating repository

On windows

Problem solved (https://sourceforge.net/p/adempiere/discussion/610548/thread/502bc2e3/)

Still, there might be people who face the problem, but ignore the solution

A page should be written, explaining the problem and the solution (not any responsible appointed)

Problems with Metas' contrbutions: seems that merging from original branches was wrong. Victor will help RM to overcome this.

Task on RM: to get the repository stable so tests can begin
[06:13:37] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Are we ready to start?
[06:13:43] Mario Calderón: yes
[06:14:00] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): we need s moderator ... volunteers?
[06:14:14] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): we need a secretry .. volunteers?
[06:14:40] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Mario .. will u be sec?
[06:15:02] Mario Calderón: +1
[06:15:52] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): in the absence of any other candidate :-(   I will be moderator?
[06:16:06] Mario Calderón: :) you're the chosen
[06:16:55] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok .. the main issue in the last meeting was related to git and mercurial .. we really need Victor to be part of any discussion on that matter however..
[06:17:38] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): we have Mike here hopefully .. who has been exploring the issue with new eyes and has written up some notes for guidance in the wiki.
[06:18:31] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I would like Mike to  let us know his thoughts
[06:18:46] Mario Calderón: if not, he could put his observations here when he bounces back?
[06:20:16] Michael McKay: First, the main thing is to keep the processes as simple as possible so that developers can contribute without frustration and problems.  Both HG and Git are designed to do their job simply.  The issue is getting them to work together simply.
[06:21:52] Michael McKay: On windows, the issue for me seemed to be Mercurial versions <= 2.7.1. The recent 2.7.2 version works well and has solved the issues.  I can now update to pre git revesions and back to the tip without issues.  I have not tried commits to the git repo yet.
[06:22:22] Mario Calderón: so your recommendation?
[06:22:52] Michael McKay: I'm not sure if others have problems and I'd like to know Suman's experience and issues - are they still holding things up.
[06:23:18] suman ravuri: Hi Mike, have you tried switching between repos?
[06:23:38] suman ravuri: I mean branches?
[06:24:11] Michael McKay: Yes.  I can move around and update normally and the git is removed or added without issue.
[06:25:12] suman ravuri: did you try with simple commit?
[06:25:24] suman ravuri: after switching braches
[06:25:45] Michael McKay: No.  I can do so later this morning.  Is that where you are having issues?
[06:26:13] suman ravuri: yes
[06:26:35] suman ravuri: I need to manually remove and add git repos manually
[06:26:53] suman ravuri: I am using older version of hg
[06:26:57] suman ravuri: that could be the problem
[06:29:16] suman ravuri: I will upgrade hg and verify once
[06:29:44] Michael McKay: 2.7.2 fixed the error of invalid handles that was preventing updates.  It works on the command line, but not with TortoiseHG - there I have to use the command line version.
[06:30:33] suman ravuri: I am using tortoisehg to simply integration work
[06:30:51] suman ravuri: sourcetree is also started working in windows
[06:31:28] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): so, what is next steps?
[06:31:49] suman ravuri: if sourcetree can work with latest hg then that can be one good option
[06:32:15] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): when can that be tested?
[06:32:49] suman ravuri: I will get this tested tomorrow from my end
[06:34:37] Michael McKay: I'm my opinion, removing git now will be difficult.  If we can get the CM software to work (including both hg and git) in a simple fashion, we should proceed.  Undoing the hg repo at this point will be a major challenge.
[06:35:35] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Suman, your view? assuming it can be made to work as Mike outlined?
[06:36:40] suman ravuri: let me try with new hg and then I will be able to comment
[06:37:04] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok .. lets leave this till after some more testing .. agreed?
[06:37:12] Mario Calderón: ok
[06:37:38] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Suman, can you update us on what has been done in the last week please.
[06:38:09] suman ravuri: 1. Manufacturing Light separate branch(ADEMPIERE-216-ManufacturingLite) creation and committed the changes. - Done

2. Deepak's SmartJSP report changes integration - Done

3. Migration fixes of Smart Report and CurrencyExchange - Done

4. Configurable dashboards - Inprogress



Waiting for metas to fix the process gear which has unnecessary code changes and wrong migration scripts?If metas can not fix in certain time, we may need to revert the changes
[06:39:05] Victor Perez Juarez: So i think that we need Switch to git but can be after 380
[06:39:12] Mario Calderón: ok copied
[06:39:25] Mario Calderón: hi Victor
[06:40:30] Victor Perez Juarez: Hi
[06:40:40] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): @Suman, are you waiting for feedback from someone at Metas?
[06:40:58] suman ravuri: I sent mail to Cristina
[06:40:59] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): hi Victor..
[06:41:04] Michael McKay: One last point - Suman - try the thg.exe version of TortoiseHG instead of the thgw.exe version.   The former is working for me.  (TortoiseHG version 2.9.2 with mercurial 2.7.2.)
[06:41:22] suman ravuri: I expecting resposnse from her
[06:42:05] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): How long can you leave it to get some fixes?

[06:47:14] Victor Perez Juarez: What was conclusión can then add WM as other git sub repository ?
[06:48:35] suman ravuri: as Mike tested it seems it works well with latest hg
