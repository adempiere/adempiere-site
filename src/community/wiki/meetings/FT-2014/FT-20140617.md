[4:26:47 PM] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): sure
[4:28:57 PM] Mario Calderón: I suggest, we decide/define/find out the most important bugs which MUST be solved for going live.



We create a list and then try to assign them.



We must sort out "bugs" which are not proved, but just recorded by somebody.
[4:29:24 PM] Steven Sackett (Adaxa):  ok .. you lead
[4:30:06 PM] Mario Calderón: which are the showstoppers?
[4:30:31 PM] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I thought we were looking at each issue to decide that and to allocate to a person rather than leave unassigned.. it the unassigned that is stopping us from kmnowing what to work on
[4:30:56 PM] Mario Calderón: ok, this is in the end the same Steven...
[4:31:04 PM] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): yes
[4:31:46 PM] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): but unfortunately it requires us to look at each one
[4:31:55 PM] Victor Perez Juarez: I'm confused :-(

Victor, do you agree?
