[06:15:55] Karsten Thiemann: hi
[06:16:32] Karsten Thiemann: ha - stupid skype client
[06:16:39] Karsten Thiemann: sorry guys
[06:16:50] Colin ROONEY: :) I wasn't sure I was doing it right!
[06:17:10] Mario Calderón: hi Karsten
[06:17:17] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Hi Karsten
[06:17:53] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Mario, you were going to follow up with hosting our test instances through ADeV
[06:18:04] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): can you pls advise us
[06:18:40] Mario Calderón: yes, I contacted Norbert, Mark and Tobi and they offerde their help
[06:20:17] Mario Calderón: then Victor contacted them asking for credentials to install clients. I don't know what happened next, but it seems hehasn't advanced yet.
Paul Aviles said he would do whatever we ask for..
[06:21:23] Mario Calderón: so, we should either ask Victor to carry it out with Metas' server or Paul's
[06:21:35] Mario Calderón: the fastest way
[06:22:22] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): suggestions?
[06:22:58] Mario Calderón: Victor should install with Paul's server or Metas', whichever is fastest to install
[06:23:44] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok, shall we leave it as FT/TT meeting minutes January 07th 2014
Victor to install on the hardware of whoever responds first
[06:24:04] Mario Calderón: I can coordinate it
[06:24:37] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok.
[06:25:55] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Suman sent an email with 2 attachments.  the first was a plan to create a program to delete the entries associated with receiving and valuing inventory so we could delete stuff and then retest without having to re-enter all the data.
[06:26:03] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): has anyone read that document?
[06:26:25] Mario Calderón: not me
[06:26:52] Colin ROONEY: I've not seen it either
[06:27:27] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): can I add it here as a file transfer?
[06:27:38] Karsten Thiemann: would be nice
[06:27:49] Mario Calderón: yes please
[06:28:07] * Steven Sackett (Adaxa) sent file Reset_Costing_Design.docx.
[06:28:18] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): sending
[06:28:56] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): can anyone see it transferring? not shown in this linux client
[06:29:25] Karsten Thiemann: fyi - I just added an Community Test page to the wiki but I think that most links are outdated http://wiki.adempiere.net/Release_380LTS_Community_Test
[06:30:17] Colin ROONEY: @Steven, I see the file but it jusrt says is not available - it might be still uploading on your side?
[06:31:05] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): it wont work .. can i email it?
[06:31:19] Karsten Thiemann: yes please
[06:31:21] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): or add it to a page?
[06:32:58] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Karsten, I emailed it to you .. perhaps you can add to a page .. too technical for me!
[06:33:38] Karsten Thiemann: ok
[06:33:54] Michael McKay: Morning all.  Can I make some major changes to the SAHI scripts in the ADempiere_test_suite?  I've done a lot of work in my contribution test suite and the two are not compatible any longer.



I got the file.
[06:34:14] Mario Calderón: morning Mike
[06:34:34] Karsten Thiemann: guess you are on our graylist - so it might take a while..
[06:34:42] Mario Calderón: +1 from me
[06:34:54] Mario Calderón: I got the files w/o problem
[06:35:08] Colin ROONEY: @steven - saved now!
[06:35:21] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): good
[06:37:12] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): the document from Suman was his plan to aid testing of costing entries. anyone who is technical and can give some feedback .. would be helpful.  probably offline.
[06:37:32] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Can we go to Sumans second document.
[06:37:45] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): mainly text so posted here....Updating the values of 'Date' Or 'Date+Time' Type fields

We will use a form Modify Date Fields.

This process will take two parameters:
1. Table

2. No Of years

Table: User will select the table name from the drop down list. The values of the fields/columns which have the Reference ' Date ' or 'Date+Time' will be modified for this Table. If user does not select any table name then system will get all the tables ( except tables  which have names starting with 'A_' or 'AD_'  and any suggestions to skip).

No Of Years: This parameter takes the no of years that is to be added to the date field values.

Constraint: 

If the date field value is NULL for a record in a table then we do not make any change to that date field value in that record.

[06:39:19] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): that seems sensible ... however the work may have been done already (at adaxa) .. I will co-ordinate with Suman to avoid duplication.
[06:41:09] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Other things on agenda?
[06:41:22] Mario Calderón: Mike's and Karsten's
[06:41:28] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok
[06:41:41] Mario Calderón: Karsten with community test page and Mike with SAHI
[06:42:01] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Karsten .. over to you.
[06:42:05] Karsten Thiemann: ok
[06:42:34] Karsten Thiemann: so there is a skeleton of a community test page here: http://wiki.adempiere.net/Release_380LTS_Community_Test
[06:42:56] Karsten Thiemann: it is taken from our last bug month 2 years ago
[06:43:17] Karsten Thiemann: we need to update the links to the actual test instances
[06:43:49] Mario Calderón: can you be the coordinator of the page? Suman can help you here....
[06:43:51] Karsten Thiemann: but the main problem I see is that we don't have a current bug and feature list
[06:44:02] Karsten Thiemann: yes I can do the coordination
[06:44:10] Mario Calderón: he and Victor are the ones who know most
[06:45:17] Karsten Thiemann: Am I right that we want to test all fixed bugs and new features since 3.7.0?
[06:45:34] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): yes.. I think so.
[06:46:38] Michael McKay: Shouldn't we be using JIRA for this?  Its better at bug tracking and less work for all of us.
[06:46:52] Mario Calderón: @Karste: yes, it must
[06:47:08] Karsten Thiemann: do we have all bugs and features in JIRA?
[06:47:17] Mario Calderón: Victor wanted to include the JIRA bug page in our test page
[06:47:30] Mario Calderón: don't know if he managed to do it
[06:47:43] Karsten Thiemann: I'll ask him
[06:47:51] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I saw he lodged a bug report there in the week.
[06:48:45] Michael McKay: I believe all the features were documented in Jira as the contributions were made.  Suman can confirm.
[06:50:51] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Suman cant attend today .. is the documenting in Jira in addition to what was written up in the adempiere.com (wiki.adempiere.net) wiki pages .. coz thats all I have seen
[06:51:42] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): anyone?
[06:52:57] Karsten Thiemann: at least there are some features in the list - not sure if all
[06:53:16] Karsten Thiemann: but it looks good to me
[06:54:46] Karsten Thiemann: so do we want to use jira and engage the community to get an account?
[06:55:11] Karsten Thiemann: or will we make a copy somewhere to lower the borders to participate?
[06:55:30] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): from what I can see, all the issues are what has been put there by Victor about stuff he has contributed ... anyone see other stuff?
[06:56:01] Karsten Thiemann: tobias has added the new dunning functionality
[06:56:12] Michael McKay: I mad sure anything I've done is there.
[06:56:25] Michael McKay: made
[06:57:13] Karsten Thiemann: Suman added some features as well
[06:59:47] Karsten Thiemann: maybe we should provide a how to (how to get an account, assign for a bug, find the code of the rc (or the online instance running the webui) and commit the test result and put it on the community test page
[07:00:28] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): good idea .. I should think only developers would know all this stuff.
[07:01:39] Mario Calderón: who will write the doc? I think last time Mike wanted to create a how-to get a JIIRA account..
[07:01:52] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): this was in last weeks mintes..."... write a document how to get a JIRA account so non-technical people can follow bug fixing"
[07:02:11] Michael McKay: Its on my to-do list.
[07:02:51] Karsten Thiemann: The other thing is - last time we fixed all (or most) of the reported bugs and the testin was to check if they where _really_ fixed. Not just that a developer said that is was fixed. But most tasks in the list are unresolved. So what should we do?
[07:03:47] Mario Calderón: can we do it the same way?
[07:04:19] Mario Calderón: @Mike: copied
[07:07:57] Karsten Thiemann: @Mario: So first complete the ~200 open tasks? I think the idea of jira is to have a process that makes sure that if a task is closed the problem is resolved.
[07:09:27] Colin ROONEY: I think with the who dual repos story it was difficult to create a testing environment - I certainly failed.  Hopefully with the new testing servers setup anyone should be able to test - at least via the zkwebui - swing might still require some skills to setup a local test environment
[07:09:47] Colin ROONEY: who=whole
[07:10:51] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): can I summarise as ... we will use Jira  ... we need documentation so it's not too intimidating for non-developers otherwise only developers will test .. and what could possibly go wrong with that!
[07:11:21] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): can we get some documentation within a week?  Mike?
[07:11:28] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Karsten?
[07:13:09] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): and we will have test instances set up with Paul or ADeV , whichever happens sooner
[07:15:29] Karsten Thiemann: The workflow that we have setup in Jira is quite simple its like 1.create issue 2.triage pending 3.triage in progress 4.Resolved (if a quick fix) or Open and then 5.Closed

But this can and often will be done by the same person.
[07:16:48] Karsten Thiemann: So it is basicaly the same as in sourceforge and if we want to make sure that the problem is fixed we should go over the issues again by a different person.
[07:17:23] Karsten Thiemann: But the main problem before we can make a release is that there are about 200 open issues..
[07:18:41] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Karsten, where do you go to see these 200 issues?
[07:19:44] Karsten Thiemann: on top there is a menu with an entry Issues
[07:19:44] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): here? https://adempiere.atlassian.net/browse/ADEMPIERE-47?jql=project%20%3D%20ADEMPIERE
[07:19:52] Mario Calderón: .. can we set up the page, start working and on the way decide about it? Perhaps some are minor bugs, outdated, etc..
[07:21:36] Karsten Thiemann: https://adempiere.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ADEMPIERE%20AND%20status%20in%20%28Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened%2C%20%22Triage%20Pending%22%2C%20%22Triage%20In%20Progress%22%2C%20%22QA%20Technical%20Review%22%2C%20%22QA%20Funcional%20Review%22%2C%20%22Test%20Validation%22%2C%20%22New%20Feature%20Inclusion%22%29
[07:22:16] Michael McKay: There is a way to setup a test capture - https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CAPTURE/Working+with+Sessions#WorkingwithSessions-DifferencesbetweenTestSessionsandTestCases
[07:24:31] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): thanks ... will read that later.
[07:24:52] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): so, how can we work on these 200 issues?
[07:26:03] Michael McKay: Triage.  What needs to be fixed and what do we live with?  If it hasn't been fixed, I think we live with it at this point.
[07:26:19] Karsten Thiemann: like for example https://adempiere.atlassian.net/browse/ADEMPIERE-231
[07:26:43] Mario Calderón: ok
[07:26:51] Mario Calderón: so we must encourage triage
[07:27:01] Karsten Thiemann: but who will decide this?
[07:31:10] Michael McKay: Rant:  this is one of the problems we have.  Complicated tools with complex processes and not enough people able to use them.  Lots of bugs, but the processes, like triage, are not used. End rant.



I think triage falls to the technical team to decide if the bug is valid, will stay on the open list or needs to be closed prior to release.
[07:31:58] Karsten Thiemann: And if new features are not integrated by now we drop them?
[07:32:49] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): according to my understanding all features that are to be added are now in .. and now we have to test
[07:33:07] Karsten Thiemann: ok
[07:33:26] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): so if not in now then leave to next release
[07:33:29] Michael McKay: Not drop, they stay on the list of potential new features as a branch. Could be included at another time.  TT and FT decide when.
[07:33:35] Mario Calderón: ok
[07:34:03] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): 2 exceptions were updating GW data and having the tools to help testing of costing engine
[07:36:19] Karsten Thiemann: But then we need to decide if we want to do a re-test of all closed issues since the last release or if we trust whoever closed the issue.
[07:36:32] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Mike, I have to leave soon... do you want to talk about Sahi?
[07:36:51] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): or more on testing arrangements?
[07:37:00] Michael McKay: Thats where sahi can help.  Automated testing of processes to ensure we haven't broken anything.
[07:37:42] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): goodnight all..
[07:37:52] Michael McKay: Good night.
[07:37:55] Mario Calderón: bye Steven
[07:40:28] Michael McKay: What I have been doing with SAHI is creating a new client and then generating data to test each type of document.  Not everything is tested - the focus is on the new stuff and the features of how the windows work.  Its entirely web based so the ZK interface has to be fully functional.
[07:40:43] Mario Calderón: ok
[07:41:02] Mario Calderón: how can others run your tests Mike?
[07:41:28] Michael McKay: We tried last time to make this an automated test of the nightly build.  I'd like to try this again and may need to access the server to get it running.
[07:42:08] Michael McKay: Essentially, the adempiere_test_suite becomes another task for Husdon(?).
[07:42:39] Michael McKay: Its not perfect but its a heck of a lot better than manually testing.
[07:43:33] Mario Calderón: ok, I will ask TObi/Victor
[07:43:57] Mario Calderón: I think they know most about it (Tobi I suppose most)
[07:44:04] Michael McKay: I'll try to get an example working on amazon too.
[07:44:25] Mario Calderón: @Mike: or can you ask fTobi ?
[07:44:30] Michael McKay: Sure.
[07:44:44] Mario Calderón: other items?
[07:46:17] Michael McKay: Who as admin control of Jira?
[07:46:25] Mario Calderón: Teo Sarca
[07:46:45] Michael McKay: OK. Thanks.
[07:49:12] Mario Calderón: I think that is all for today.

I hope we have the infrastructe fot testing by next week
[07:49:22] Mario Calderón: anything else?
[07:50:01] Michael McKay: Not from me.  Have a great day.
[07:50:58] Karsten Thiemann: see you
[07:51:04] Mario Calderón: bye ab¿nd have a nice day!
