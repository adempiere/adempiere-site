Forkings are expected in Open Source, and for Compiere, this is probably the 4th or 5th fork, as stated by Jorg Janke, its creator in the private Partner's Forum.

But for this latest fork, we regard ourselves to be the Last Fork as we conduct ourselves from the onset in an open and unabated manner, as can be clearly seen here red1.org/forum thread. This thread is now refered and linked worldwide by many online news and regarded to as the Famous Forking Debate by the Compiere community.

The proof of this as Last Fork is when contributions do actually come forth from all sides and the notable ones are stated on the [ADempiere](http://adempiere.org/) one page site.
