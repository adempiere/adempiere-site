## Introduction

How did the ADempiere story really started? Here Redhuan D. Oon tries to recap the sequence of events in history based on emails. This is meant to be a historical reference.

## Started With Emails

## Victor Perez calls for action

- Fri, 11 Aug 2006 22:00:54 -0500

- Email sent to: trifonnt at yahoo dot com, mar9000 at gmail dot com, lombardo at mayking dot com, red1 at red1 dot org, robeklein at gmail dot com, zpshen at gmail dot com, carlos dot ruiz at globalqss dot com, alejandro dot falcone at gmail dot com, fernando dot jimenez at e-evolution dot com dot mx, miguel dot jimenez at e-evolution dot com dot mx, oscar dot gomez at e-evolution dot com dot mx, lancona at 4layer dot it, mquezada at bodevidrio dot com, ramiro dot vergara at ofbconsulting dot com

_Hi Guys!_

- My name is Victor Perez, I am CEO of e-Evolution,S.C., The reason of this e-mail and attachment file is to share dream with you and invite you to be part of it. My dream is to create a System ERP CRM SCM for and owned by the comunnitty, a System that improves day by day.
- In my experience, I have been working with Compiere for 5 years. I have gotten many satisfactions, and I have taken advantage of the great job made by Jorg Janke with Compiere
- With the acquired experience I have a personal dream: to create a project that evolves from Compiere, a project with edge technology where everyone can share their ideas , with license GPL, where the problems of the end users are listened, where I can integrate my job with the job of others, where the requirements of my clients are taken into account, where my clients feel a real support, in summary something to be improved.
- Is for that reason that I dare to invite everyone interested in this proposal , with a big desire of working and to support this dream together.
- What do you think ? Any question or suggestion please send it to me.PD: I will appreciate that you keep this document for yourself, until have everybody feedback
_Victor Perez Juarez_

## Initial Reluctance

- I refused to entertain initially and felt that this was mischievous and a call to fork which wasn't necessary based on the limited information i had at that time.

## Trifon reforwarded Victor's Request

- Thu, 17 Aug 2006 11:37:09 -0700 (PDT)
- Trifon replied to Victor who asked if Redhuan D. Oon received the earlier emails.

These depends on us but , Yes , the first plan is to make a fork that covers all the needs of the community, which arent of ComPiere 's interest, in the presentation i tried to show these needs.

I think that we can have two strategies:

In the First place we can refer that it is based on ComPiere, althouth the changes that i am propousing are very ambicious, this includes in bring the good and bad things that ComPiere already has, i.e. The inestability, the lack of support, the good marketing , the great platform, etc

If the project borns to solve all the issues on compiere and we can achieve this, It is convenient for us to say that this software is based in ComPiere?

Ok, e-evolution will includes in the project all our code which is until now Manufacture (BOM,Wokflow & Routing,Manufacturing Order, MRP, CRP, Shop floor) , Human Resources & Payroll, Cash Flow ,PostgreSQL port. y suppose that we can integrate too the fixed Assets project from Rob and the work that another people wants to integrate to the project.

Aditionaly we will start the changes propoused in the document i sent you.

Exactly i thinkthat this has to evolve naturally, but it should have a better impact if the community leaders are involved in the project.

We will have to start a well defined goal and road map.

Before we officially start with this project, I want to create a strong community group, my intention is not to have a project like JazzERP or Open Bravo which arent , from my point of view, apporting to much with their fork.

Exactly Jorg has a high value code, the reason to use ComPiere is to take a good phrase that a migted sitted over a giant shoulders can see farest than the giant.

In summary what i am propousing in the document are very specific improvements, all this issues were very recurrents among the users and my customers that are working with compiere right now, ComPiere doesnt have this kind of feedback because they doesnt provide first level support.

Antoher crucial difference is to mantain a 100% open source project, having knowledge that ComPiere is going to change their business model , and there will be several versions, Compiere GPL, Compiere Light and Compiere Enterprise.

## Forking Debate Venue Identified

Hi all,

I agree with what proposed Carlos. I think that we need agree with the different alternatives that we have (fork, another existent project, talk with Compiere Inc., or something else). Red1, are you in agreement that we begin a discussion in your forum?

Kind regards

Alejandro Falcone

carlos dot ruiz at globalqss dot com escribió: Hello, I've read some of your comments and I share some of them. But I think at this moment the discussion must not be technical, this is an issue that we must discuss later.

I propose to start a thread of discussion - maybe in red1 forum - about the possibility of forking Compiere, the implications, the team needed, etc. (If partners want to discuss this issue privately I think they can post as anonymous on forum).

I believe this is a reality we're confronting, every day looks more like Compiere is going proprietary. Or at least Compiere is going to have a version "only for partners", which is going to leave the "non-partners" in a bad position to give support, make enhancements, etc.

I believe that we're going to confront a situation of "partner, fork or go to another project" in a term of months. Maybe we can discuss the fork possibility, or the "go to another project" like OpenBravo, or the possibility to conform a community that talk to Compiere Inc. about we're thinking (not as individuals, but as community).

What do you think? Can we discuss this matter on Red1 forum?

Regards,

Carlos Ruiz
