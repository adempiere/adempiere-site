ADempiere is a open-source project using [commons-based peer-production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production) methods. Organized as a bazaar of [Citizens](/community/citizens/README.md), the project is governed by [Technical](a), [Functional](a) and [Community Council Teams](/community/community-council-team/README.md). The intellectual property of the community is protected by the ADempiere Foundation, a non-profit group which provides legal and financial support to the community.

The project follows a Open Source philosophy with a 3-line principle of:
