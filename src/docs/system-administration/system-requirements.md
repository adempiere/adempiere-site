ADempiere system requirements vary considerably with the complexity of the enterprise being supported. This page provides a minimum set of system requirements.
It is possible to install ADempiere on a single computer with the database, server and client all running on the same machine. This is quite adequate for evaluation or very small applications. In a production environment such a simple installation may not be sufficient, especially when there are more than a handful of concurrent users. Performance demands will require more attention to the architecture of the installation. In a production environment, it is highly recommended to separate the servers, with the [Application Server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_server) and [Database Server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_server) on different machines.

For installations with more than 10 users, ensure you do your homework. See specifics about your database or consult with a database specialist for correct hardware architecture, database tuning and query tuning.For PostgreSQL, see Postgres Performance Hardware Design Tuning Your PostgreSQL Server Using EXPLAIN (Query Tuning) | | :--- | :--- |

The following sections describe the main requirements and options.

## ADempiere Application Server Requirements

### Software

- **Operating Systems**: Choose one of the following options based on your preference and requirements:

    - Microsoft Vista, Windows 7, or later (Note: Support will be limited by the supporting stack of Java and the database.)

    - OpenSolaris
    - MAC OSX

## Hardware

- **Architecture of Hardware**: Choose the hardware architecture based on your requirements:

    - [Intel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XEON)
    - [AMD Opteron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opteron)
    - [Sparc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC)
    - [Power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Architecture)

Some configuration of the database is needed or you need to use a different tool. For that reason, 11g is not "officially" supported. | | :--- | :--- |
