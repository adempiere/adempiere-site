### How to Install Git?

1. To download Git, you must have an account created.

If you want to install **Git** on Linux through a binary installer, you can generally do so using your distribution's package management tool. For example, on **Fedora**, you can use yum:

```shell
yum install git
```

On a Debian-based distribution like Ubuntu, you can use apt-get:

```shell
sudo apt-get install git
```

For additional options, the **Git** website has installation instructions for different types of Unix. You can find this information [here](http://git-scm.com/download/linux).

To configure Git to use your GitHub account when making commits, there are some settings you need to check and adjust.

```shell
git config --global user.name "YourGitHubUsername"

git config --global user.email "YourGitHubEmailAddress"
```

Make sure to replace **"YourGitHubUsername"** and **"YourGitHubEmailAddress"** with your GitHub credentials.

The **--global** option sets these settings globally, meaning they will apply to all your repositories.

- Verify Git's current configuration:
You can check Git's current configuration by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

These commands will show you the username and email address configured in Git.

### How to Download Visual Studio Code?

- If you're using a Red Hat-based system like Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you should select the **.rpm** file.

- If you're using a Debian-based system like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or Debian, then you should select the **.deb** file.

#### GitHub Pull Requests And Issues

Finally, it is essential to configure authentication in Git through VS Code to interact with GitHub. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to Accounts.
3. Select Sign in with GitHub....

```

- Update the profile:

```shell
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" # This loads bash completion for nvm 
```

- Install Node.js

```shell
nvm install 20.10.0
```

## Forking the Official ADempiere Documentation Repository

You can find the repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere-site).

To fork the repository, follow these steps:

Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the page.

![go-to-fork](/assets/img/product/how-to-install/go-to-fork.png)

You will be redirected to the **Create a new fork** section. Uncheck the option to only copy the `main` branch and click **Create fork**.

![create-new-fork](/assets/img/product/how-to-install/create-new-fork.png)

### Download Cloned Repository

1. Copy the link of the cloned repository.

![copy-link](/assets/img/product/how-to-install/copy-link.png)

2. Go to the terminal and write the following command, for example:


```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-user/adempiere-site
```

3. Open **Visual Studio Code** > **Open Folder**

![open-folder](/assets/img/product/how-to-install/open-folder.png)

Look for the repository and open it.

![select-folder](/assets/img/product/how-to-install/select-folder.png)

Visual Studio Code shows a message the first time it opens a folder. Here Visual Studio Code asks if it should be trusted or not.

- If you select **No, I don't trust the authors**, Visual Studio Code will open the workspace in restricted mode.

- If you select **Yes, I trust the authors**, Visual Studio Code will trust the current workspace and enable all the editor features you are used to.

Activate the checkbox and select **Yes, I trust the authors**.

### How to Commit from Visual Studio Code?

Go to **Git Graph** > **Right-click on main** > **Create Branch**

![create-branch](/assets/img/product/how-to-install/create-branch.png)

Name the branch. This created branch is where you will work, meaning, create or modify files, insert images, among other functions.

![name-branch](/assets/img/product/how-to-install/name-branch.png)

For example, documentation files are located in src, as shown in the image.

![files](/assets/img/product/how-to-install/files.png)

Add information to a file.

![changes](/assets/img/product/how-to-install/changes.png)

When making a change to a file, you must validate that it is correct. To do this, build the page to visualize the changes.

Press **ctrl + j** to display the terminal from Visual Studio Code and install the dependencies:

```shell
# Using npm
npm install

# Or using yarn
yarn install
```

Subsequently, run to run the page:

```shell
npm run dev:vite
```

Here you can visualize the changes.

![changed-successfully](/assets/img/product/how-to-install/changed-successfully.png)

To commit, go to Source Control > and you will see the file that underwent changes > You can add a message and then commit. Once the commit is done, you must go to your repository on Github where you will see the option to make a pull request, this being the final step, and there is nothing left but to wait for it to be accepted by an administrator.
