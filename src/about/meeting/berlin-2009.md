## 2nd. European ADempiere conference in Berlin

**June 21st – 23rd 2009**

For the first time in May 2007, developers from all over the world, involved in the open-source project ADempiere, met up for the first European ADempiere conference at the FHTW in Berlin.

Though the project leader Red1 is of the opinion that the possibilities one has with the internet today are sufficient to connect team members and be successful on projectslike ADempiere, the internet still a virtual place with a virtual community.

With this first conference every member of the "ADempiere Bazaar" community turned from a virtual to a real person for everyone else; nicknames became real names and real faces. This personal exchange between community members lead to a good speed-up in the project development.

To engage everyone in another personal meeting, the 2nd European ADempiere conference will take place in Berlin from June 21st till 23rd.

The conference will focus on technical improvements in ADempiere and on optimizing the social structure of the ADempiere community to be even more successful in terms of development and distribution.

Altogether we'll use the weekend to exchange personal experiences with the software as well as to improve documentation, code and localization – and of course to have a bunch of fun!
