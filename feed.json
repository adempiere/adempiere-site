The vision of our project is &quot;to inspire people to share&quot;. This theme is central to the way the ADempiere community collaborates. ADempiere members of the community need to work together effectively, and a code of conduct lays down the &quot;ground rules&quot; for our cooperation.</p>\n<p>Our motto perfectly captures the spirit of sharing and cooperation that is at the core of the open source movement. In the Free Software world, we collaborate freely on a volunteer basis to build software for everyone's benefit. We improve the work of others, which we have received for free, andthen share our improvements on the same basis.</p>\n<p>This collaboration depends on good relationships between developers. To this end, we have agreed on the following code of conduct to help define the waysthat we think collaboration and cooperation should be made.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<h2 id=\"basic-rules-of-the-community\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Basic Rules of the Community</h2>\n<p>This Code of Conduct covers your behavior as a member of the ADempiere Community, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, IRC channel, public meeting or private correspondence. The ADempiere Association arbitrate in any dispute over the conduct of a member of the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Be considerate</strong>. Your work will be used by other people, and you depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, andwe hope you will take into account the consequences when making decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Be respectful</strong>. The ADempiere community and its members treat each other with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to the ADempiere project. You may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We can all experience some frustration now and then, but we can not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. It is important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not productive. We expect members of the ADempiere community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside the Adempiere Project</p>\n<p><strong>Be collaborative</strong>. The ADempiere project and Free Software are all about collaboration and teamwork. Collaboration reduces redundancy of work done in the Free Software world, and improves the quality of the software produced. You should try to work with other ADempiere implementers, as well as others in the communitymay be interested in the work you do. Your work should be done transparently and patches of Adempiere, when performed, should be given to the community. If you want to work on new code for new projects, at least keep those projects informed of your ideas and progress. It may not be possible to obtain the consensus of the project or even from your colleagues about the correct implementation of an idea, so do not feel obliged to have that agreement before you begin, but at least keep informedthe outside world of your work, and publishyour work in a way that allowsothers to test, discuss and contribute to your efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>When you disagree, check</strong>. Disagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time and the ADempiere community is no exception. The important thing is not to avoid disagreements or differences of opinion but to resolve them constructively. Go to the community and the community process to seek advice and to resolve disagreements.The ADempierecommunity will help you decide the right course for the project. There are also several Project Teams and Team. Leaders, who may be able to help you figure out which direction would be moreacceptable. If you really want to go a different way, then we encourage you to make a derivative distribution or alternative set of packages available using the framework of ADempiere package management, so that the community can try these changes and ideas for themselves and contribute to the discussion.</p>\n<p><strong>When you are unsure, ask for help</strong>. Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the ADempiere community. Asking questions avoids many problems down the road, so we encourage questions. Theperson you ask would most probable be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, you must be careful to do so in an appropriate forum.</p>\n<p><strong>Leave with consideration</strong>. Developers on every project come and go and the ADempiere project is no different. When youleave the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you're working with you, you are leaving and take appropriate measures to ensure that others can pick up where you leave.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shearing\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Shearing</h2>\n<p>The Code of Conduct ADempiere is based on Ubuntu Code of Conduct. You can re-use it for your own project, and modify it as you wish, and when you allow others to use your modifications,please give credit to the ADempiere project.</p>\n",

In order to achieve this, they hired external advice from a German company called ADV/Orga, where Jorg Janke worked as software architect.</p>\n<p>Jorg's recommendation was to rewrite R/2 which would have put in place the required multidimensional features and as such conquered the world of ERP solutions. However SAP's decision at the end involved adding more layers to the core ERP programming structures, which in turn created inefficiencies and complexities that even today subsist on most SAP implementations and other ERP software as well.</p>\n<p>After this period, Jorg Janke held other important positions with other well-known ERP vendors, until he managed to get some financing from a multinational tire manufacturer Goodyear where he was retained to develop a custom ERP that will leverage multidimensional functionality, and will allow easy customizations based on design principles that that were originally rejected by SAP.</p>\n<p>A little more than 15 years have gone and that system originally created by Jorg Janke has now evolved into ADempiere ERP a world class open source enterprise sotware package which is design from its beginnings to be easy to extend, and easy to implement.</p>\n",

Association's purpose</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The purpose of the association is the promotion and dissemination of free ERP software in the sense of free software while taking the Adempiere programme package into special consideration. Free software, also referred to as &quot;open source software&quot;, in accordance with this charter is considered to be computer programmes which are provided free of charge to the general public by the author in a non-retrievable manner. The author thus grants to third parties the freedom to use the programme for any purpose, to examine how the programme functions and to modify it for one's own needs, to make copies for other persons and to improve the programme and to make these improvements available to the general public.</li>\n<li>The association's purpose is particularly realised through\n<ul>\n<li>The promotion of education, the exchange of opinions and the cooperation of users, developers and researchers</li>\n<li>The continued development of and research for free ERP software</li>\n<li>The provision of free ERP software, supporting photos, sounds, data and documentation as well as the promotion of its availability and the preparation and dissemination of informational materials for it</li>\n<li>Contributions to the technical information of the public in the sphere of activities of the association and participation in trade fairs and seminars in order to make the information available to a broader spectrum of users</li>\n<li>Organisation of seminars and generally accessible presentations in order to provide continuing education to the project participants and users</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The association shall pursue no commercial purposes of its own. It shall not endeavour to earn a profit. It is not permitted to have political and ideological goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"_3-non-profit-status\" tabindex=\"-1\"> 3. Non-profit status</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In accordance with its duties that are specified in § 2 of the charter, the association is pursuing, exclusively and directly, charitable purposes in accordance with the section of the tax code regarding tax advantages (§§ 51ff. AO). It is non-profit and does not primarily pursue its own commercial goals.</li>\n<li>The funds of the association are to be used exclusively for the purposes specified in the charter. The members receive exclusively reimbursements of their costs incurred, but no direct appropriations from the association's funds.</li>\n<li>No one may benefit for expenditures of the association which are not related to the association's purpose or through disproportionately high compensation. The Federal Travel Cost Act shall be prevailing for the reimbursement of expenditures provided that no other statutory provisions are applicable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"_4-types-of-membership-and-members-of-the-association\" tabindex=\"-1\"> 4. Types of membership and members of the association</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Members of the association may be natural and juridical persons who wish to support and help to pursue the goals of the association. In order to give members the option of withdrawing from the active support of the continuing development of Adempiere without giving up their membership, the following types of memberships are available:\n<ul>\n<li>Active members are natural persons who support the association's mission and the realisation of the association's goals through cooperation and, in so doing, assume the full obligations of an association member. In particular, it is expected that they will participate in cooperations and members' meetings and exercise voting rights.</li>\n<li>Passive members are natural and juridical persons who declare their support of the association's mission and goals through their membership in the association, but opt not to exercise the rights of active members, in this case, the exercising of voting rights. Juridical persons shall designate a natural person as their representative in order to exercise any still applicable rights and obligations.</li>\n<li>Sponsoring members are natural and juridical persons who promote the association's mission and goals, particularly through a financial or non-financial contribution. At their own request, they may be listed on the association's web site and have the right to participate in members' meetings without acquiring voting rights.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Active membership may be acquired upon the recommendation of an active member subject to the approval of two other active members by means of a resolution of the members' meeting or the active members through an Internet vote with a simple majority. The main decision-making criterion for acceptance is supposed to be the candidate for acceptance's commitment shown over a longer period of time and resulting contributions made in the sense of the association's goals.</li>\n<li>Upon his own request to the management board, an active member may change his membership to a passive membership. In the aforementioned obligations of an active member are not fulfilled for two successive ordinary members' meetings, his membership shall automatically change into a passive membership. A passive member may request that the management board grant him active membership. The management board shall rule regarding the acceptance of sponsoring members.</li>\n<li>A passive member can apply for active membership at the board in case it used to an active member in the past. Otherwise 4.2 apply to gain active membership.</li>\n<li>Sponsoring membership is given by the board.</li>\n<li>The membership shall end through resignation, expulsion or death; for juridical persons, also through the loss of legal personality. The resignation of a member is possible only on 31 December of each year. Such a resignation shall be announced by means of a written declaration submitted to the management board while providing four weeks' notice.</li>\n<li>The instrument for expulsion from the association shall be reserved to critical situations whereby clarification of the issue should take precedence. Expulsion shall be made with immediate effectiveness upon a resolution of the management board. The following may be reasons for an expulsion:\n<ul>\n<li>A major violation of a member against the provisions of this charter as well as well as goals and purposes of the association after an unsuccessful attempt at clarification as well as</li>\n<li>Despite multiple warnings, payments of membership dues in arrears for a timeframe of 12 months.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Before the adopting of a resolution, the member must be given the opportunity to provide a legal justification or take a statement of position. An objection to the exclusion may be submitted to the management board within four weeks upon which the next members' meeting shall rule. Until a decision is made by the members' meeting, the rights and obligations of the member shall be suspended.</li>\n<li>If a member leaves the association or the association is dissolved, no claim to the reimbursement of financial assets that have been contributed shall apply.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"_5-bodies-of-the-association\" tabindex=\"-1\"> 5.

      "content_html": "<h1 id=\"adempiere-world-conference-in-berlin\" tabindex=\"-1\"> ADempiere World Conference in Berlin</h1>\n<p><strong>September 2nd till 4th of 2014</strong></p>\n<p>In May 2007 the 1st European ADempiere conference in Berlin – organized by the German ADempiere association – brought together developers from all over the world.</p>\n<p>Gaining from this successful first conference, the &quot;ADempiere Bazaar&quot; community met again for the 2nd European conference in 2009; step by step transforming from a virtual community into a real community.</p>\n<p>Starting as only the German ADempiere association, these compelling conferences brought progress, and new members into the community, so that the association got the opportunity to open up and rename to be the &quot;ADempiere association&quot; with international orientation. The next step in bringing together developers from all over the world is not the European Conference, but the World Conference.</p>\n<p>Now for the first time in September 2011 the ADempiere World Conference takes place at the Beuth Technical University in Berlin.</p>\n<p>The conference tries to bring together every party interested in ADempiere: Community members, service providers, users or people solely interested in ADempiere.</p>\n<p>Notable ADempiere developers will be sharing their ADempiere know how in talks or workshops with valuable best practice advice and real world use cases.</p>\n<p>We can tell from the quickly increasing number of international participants at the conference that the community was desperately waiting for an event like this.</p>\n<p>&quot;The interest and feedback we get for the world conference is just more proof for the global collaboration of community members and the growing network around ADempiere. I'm looking forward to another great experience with this positive and progressive spirit surrounding the community.&quot; – Kai Schaeffer, chairman of the ADempiere association.</p>\n<p>Another item on the World Conference agenda is the general assembly of the association and the election of a new chairman.</p>\n<p>Of course the weekend will also be used to incorporate social events to get to know each other further and to exchange know how and experiences.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<h2 id=\"who-are-we\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Who Are We?</h2>\n<p>The ADempiere community is made up of various categories of people, and we are sure you must fit into at least one of them. There are contributors, developers, testers, writers, users, as well as businesses, authorities, experts, newbies and students. There is also a Council of trustees to be responsible for this community and the project's well-being.</p>\n<p>Each community has its own history and culture. This particular community has its roots within the <a href=\"http://sf.net/projects/compiere\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Compiere SourceForge project</a> over the last 3 years. We started as users and implementors of this great software project, and began to progress in leaps and bounds in our own capability to master it and even extend it for various end-users.</p>\n<p>The community was generally grateful to Compiere's creator, Jorg Janke, and tolerated his business model of charging users for priority support, training and the user manual. Many of us contributed code, bug reports, fixes and recommendations on how this premiere Open Source ERP/CRM solution could continue to expand. And though Jorg Janke hardly responded to the forums' messages (even those that were directly aimed at him) the Compiere community enjoyed ample support and encouragement from other community seniors on a voluntary and vigilant basis.</p>\n<p>Trouble set in soon after ComPiere Inc, USA, the commercial entity behind this project, purportedly obtained some USD6 million funding from an &quot;angel&quot; investor who soon joined its Board of Directors. Many among the paying partners of Compiere began to question new policy directions, this led to the <a href=\"http://www.compiere.com/about/board.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forking Debate</a>, and eventually sparked off the Adempiere community. The name &quot;Adempiere&quot; is an Italian word related to &quot;Compiere&quot; (which means &quot;to deliver or fulfill&quot;), but also semantically reflects the core ideal of this community: &quot;to fulfill towards completion, with respect and honour&quot;.\nLearn how to improve the current documentation and make it better for you and everybody!.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<div><p>ADempiere License</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://adempiere.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ADempiere ERP</a> is own GNU/GPL v2 License</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"adempiere-history\" tabindex=\"-1\"> ADempiere History</h2>\n<p>Our History is divided into three important milestones:</p>\n<h3 id=\"our-predecessor\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Our Predecessor</h3>\n<p>Jorg Janke, who was at the time an enterprise architect for ADV / ORGA advised SAP, while working on a consulting project for them, which architecture should be utilized for their then to be R/3 version, and how it should become a multidimensional ERP (multi company, multi-currency multi language, etc.), highly extensible and easy to configure. SAP decided to go down a different path by simply adding layers of functionality to their current product R/2.</p>\n<p>Later, as a senior architect at Oracle Jorg Janke wrote the first prototype for the application with the vision of how to implement the new paradigm of management programs. In 2000 he received financing from the tire manufacturer Goodyear in Germany and writes the first version of his product.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compiere\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Compiere</h3>\n<p>In 2000, Jorg founded a small company named Compiere Inc. to develop and provide support to his new product named also Compiere, an Italian word meaning &quot;complete&quot;.</p>\n<p>In a twist that became a milestone in the history of ERP solutions, Jorg decided to release his product under the licencing type: free GPL licensing mode, thus allowing it to be rapidly adopted around the world. Compiere Inc. business model then focused on supporting integrators named as &quot;Compiere Partners&quot; through first level support and value added services.</p>\n<p>At that time it was possible to offer Compiere on any platform since it was developed in 100% Java and Oracle as the database.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adempiere-is-born\" tabindex=\"-1\"> ADempiere is Born</h3>\n<p>In 2006 triggered by its product success  Compiere, Inc. raises financing from a group of venture capitalists moving offices from Portrland Ore., to  Silicon Valley, and at the same time, it signed a new development roadmap which included the release of  new add-ons that no longer will be licensed under the previously free GPL, but rather their own Commercial License.</p>\n<p>By makinthis decision alone will eventually convert Compiere into another commercial product like most available in the market, some of his partners asked Mr. Janke to reconsider his decision but it was actually out of his reach since he had already signed an agreement with this group of investors.</p>\n<p><strong>The Call</strong></p>\n<p>Friday August 11, 2006 &quot;We are like dwarfs on the shoulders of giants. We can see more, and beyond them, not because the sharpness of our sight but or the height of our body, but because we are raised by their height. &quot;</p>\n<p>In an email sent by Víctor Pérez quoting Bernardo de Chartres became the beginning of our ADempiere Community.</p>\n<p>&quot;My name is Victor Perez, I'm CEO of e-Evolution, The reason for this email and attachment is to share my dream with you and invite you to be part of it. My dream is to create an ERP, CRM, SCM solely owned by our community, a system that improves daily.</p>\n<p>In my experience, I have been working with Compiere for 5 years. I have received many satisfactions, and I took advantage of the great work done by Jorg Janke creator of Compiere.</p>\n<p>With the experience I acquired my personal dream to create a project that develops from Compiere, as a project with technology, where everyone can share their ideas, GPL, where problems of end users are heard, where I can integrate my work with the work of others, and should consider the needs of my clients, where my clients feel real support, in short something to improve.</p>\n<p>That is why I dare to invite all interested in this proposal, with a great desire to work and support this dream together full story see detail.&quot;</p>\n<p>Thus in September 2006, the group of integrators announced the decision to fork to a new product, totally free distributed under the GPL license, which ensures that it would never become a proprietary product and always remain free. The new product will be baptized with the name of ADempiere, an Italian word meaning &quot;Achieve&quot; and &quot;Reach&quot; which is defined by the tradition of other free software projects. The leadership and administration of ADempiere remained in the hands of the community and their representatives in the ADEV foundation in Germany.</p>\n<p>Since 2006, ADempiere has become the leader of the free world ERP implementations reported in nearly 120 countries and implementers covering all geographical areas of the world while its continuous development has enriched the functionlity permanently .</p>\n",
