If metas can not fix in certain time, we may need to revert the changes. Cristina will take care of it.\nhorizontal tab is integrated in swing\nMisc\nProblems with hg and git\nMike&#39;s findings: on windows, the issue seemed to be Mercurial versions &lt;= 2.7.1. The recent 2.7.2 version works well and has solved the issues.\nOne can now update to pre git revisions and back to the tip without issues.\nHasn&#39;t tried commits to the git repo yet.\nMike can move around and update normally and the git is removed or added without issue.\nSuman tested and it works for him.\nMike&#39;s recommendation: try the thg.exe version of TortoiseHG instead of the thgw.exe version. The former is working for me. (TortoiseHG version 2.9.2 with mercurial 2.7.2.)\nConfigurable dashboards(http://blogs.walkingtree.in/2013/03/07/configurable-dashboards/) will be added to RC\nZK versions of delete entities, GL Reconciliation and prettying up the html reports will be added to RC\nWalking Tree&#39;s Human Resource enhancements on Libero HR would be a great addition, but too late for 380. Victor will see the possibility of integrating it and adding more functionality.\n29th October: cut of date for new features\nNext meeting\nTuesday, October 29th 2013 / 12:00h.
