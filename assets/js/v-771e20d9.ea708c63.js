WT can learn by doing it\n[15:50:24] suman ravuri: Unless this branch issue is solved, we will not able to move forward\n[15:50:38] suman ravuri: this is high priority we need to get this fixed\n[15:50:50] Mario Calderón: @Suman: agree\n[15:51:54] suman ravuri: who takes prime resposnibility to fix this, I think some can work with SF\n[15:52:01] John Agudelo: my vote is for start to integrated features aproved by FT\n[15:53:47] John Agudelo: we need be more faster to obtain RC versions\n[15:54:32] John Agudelo: make somethin similiar like agile methodologys\n[15:55:34] Victor Perez Juarez: @Suman, you can continue , in begin I got the same issue\n[15:56:00] Victor Perez Juarez: but can see that is an error about the an extension that create a notice to technical team list\n[15:57:12] Victor Perez Juarez: and now not are work, I not remember who help with this in past, but I think that now we can deactivate and try integrate SF with jira to get an similar approach\n[15:57:51] Mario Calderón: there a suggestion by Steven, John and me\n[15:58:02] Mario Calderón: any other comments?\n[15:58:27] Victor Perez Juarez: about the agile methodologys, I think is complex with little team\n[15:58:30] Victor Perez Juarez: jejejej\n[15:59:31] Victor Perez Juarez: but I think that we can starting of integration when the TT was finish , then let me advance the technical team\n[15:59:42] Colin Rooney: I think the scrum method would suit very well\n[15:59:58] Colin Rooney: list of functionalities = Backlog\n[16:00:22] Victor Perez Juarez: I can go notice to RM when an contribution was review from an Technical Approach\n[16:00:23] John Agudelo: Is Scrum complex?\n[16:00:28] Colin Rooney: the week between each meeting = Sprint\n[16:00:29] Victor Perez Juarez: So RM can integarte\n[16:00:40] Mark Ostermann: hi colin\n[15:59] Colin Rooney: \n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; I think the scrum method would suit very wellThat&#39;s what we are using at metas.\n[16:00:41] Colin Rooney: these meetings the Sprint reviews\n[16:01:06] Mark Ostermann: we are doing 2-weeks sprints (started with 4 weeks, but were too long)\n[16:02:33] Victor Perez Juarez: @Colin sounds great, even to adapt it as part of ABP\n[16:02:52] Victor Perez Juarez: @Colin Any idea how to start\n[16:02:56] Mark Ostermann: problem with volunteers is, that tasks moved into sprint have to be committed before sprint starts\n[16:03:00] Mark Ostermann: and estimated\n[16:03:22] Mark Ostermann: and sprint is only successful if all tasks are completed\n[16:04:13] Victor Perez Juarez: If I understand , we need some as http://www.atlassian.com/en/software/greenhopper/overview/scrum\n[16:04:19] Colin Rooney: I think we are already working in a scrum way! Step 1 is create the backlog which = a list of tasks / functionality.\n[16:04:58] Colin Rooney: @Mark - yes people must commit to a task to be accomplished during the next &quot;Sprint&quot; (1-2 weeks as agreed)\n[16:05:05] Victor Perez Juarez: some know if Atlassian, give this tools free as Jira to project Open Source\n[16:05:12] Colin Rooney: @John - to me it&#39;s a vcery simple idea\n[16:05:13] Victor Perez Juarez: we would ask for free license\n[16:05:24] John Agudelo: In every sprint we need solve max 6 features\n[16:05:26] Mark Ostermann: @colin: agree\n[16:06:10] John Agudelo: And release a prototype or RC version and go on\n[16:06:31] Colin Rooney: there are lots of tools and pre-printed documents for scrum but I think we can use the core idea with nothing extra that what is done now.\n[16:06:33] Mario Calderón: @all: before we continue discussing Scrum, Agile, etc:\ndo we agree that Suman integrates in his branch all the contributions functionally reviewed and accepted ?\n\nThis way, the Release Manager starts having experience. Menawhile the TT finishes its tasks.\n[16:06:56] Colin Rooney: Our Backlog is the list of functionality\n[16:07:07] Colin Rooney: normally the customer is ask to choose what to do next from that list\n[16:07:14] Mario Calderón: as far , Steven, John, Victor , Mario do agree\n[16:07:24] Colin Rooney: then the team commits to achieving that in the Sprint\n[16:07:30] Colin Rooney: it&#39;s as simple as that\n[16:07:31] Victor Perez Juarez: @MArio agree for me\n[16:07:45] Mark Ostermann: [16:06] Mario Calderón: \n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; do we agree that Suman integrates in his branch all the contributions functionally reviewed and accepted ?and what about technically?\n[16:07:53] Colin Rooney: usually you have daily &quot;stand-up&quot; to be sure everyone is on target and not having problems\n[16:08:25] Colin Rooney: deployment is part of the Sprint so at the end of the sprint the customer can test the functionality promised\n[16:08:34] Colin Rooney: and that&#39;s the essence ofit\n[16:08:53] Mario Calderón: @Mark: if there is a technical inconvenience, it can be corrected, and the changeset adopted\n[16:08:59] John Agudelo: Daily stand up is only 15 minutes\n[16:09:42] Mario Calderón: important is that the Release Manager gets experience. Also it is easier to review and test.\n[16:09:51] Mark Ostermann: @mario: but what about if functionally is very nice and technically overwrites allready existing functionality?\n[16:10:18] Victor Perez Juarez: @Colin here http://www.atlassian.com/software/greenhopper/pricing, we can get the service\n[16:10:19] Victor Perez Juarez: Free for Open Source\nQualified open source projects can receive free subscriptions for Atlassian OnDemand offerings.\n[16:10:19] Mark Ostermann: then it could happen, that we are not just talking about fixing but complete refactoring\n[16:10:59] Colin Rooney: [16:06] Mario Calderón: \n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; This way, the Release Manager starts having experience. Menawhile the TT finishes its tasks.sounds like a plan to me! :)\n[16:11:02 | Edited 16:11:36] Mark Ostermann: why not let the TT just have a first look (review) before integrating?\n[16:11:29] Victor Perez Juarez: @John , Colin , would ask to Attlassian if we can get this service for adempiere and so can starting with your propose the use scrum\n[16:12:07] Mario Calderón: @Mark: I&#39;ve seen eEvolution code, and this is for sure not the case. I suppose the same Adaxa&#39;s code .\n\nIf it were code from some unknown sources, I would share your scepticiism.\n[16:12:49] Karsten Thiemann: I don&#39;t think we need another tool - the concept is simple and like colin said we can just do it without additional tools\n[16:12:56] Mark Ostermann: @Mario: Perfect, then pls. just write that u have done the TT Review and everything is perfect. ;)\n[16:12:58] Karsten Thiemann: at least for  the beginning\n[16:13:46] Mario Calderón: @Mark: I don&#39;t feel like having the deep knowledge to do it\n[16:13:51] Mark Ostermann: @Mario: I&#39;m not sceptic, just want to stay in our track.\n[16:14:36] Karsten Thiemann: @Mark - I agree, the tt needs to do a review before the integration\n[16:15:03] Mario Calderón: now: when????\n[16:15:19] Mario Calderón: who?\n[16:15:58] John Agudelo: I think that RM can start to integrate features reviwed by FT\n[16:16:08] Karsten Thiemann: who? whoever commits to the task. But at least &#39;somebody&#39; should take a look at the code before integrating it\n[16:16:39] Mark Ostermann: [16:15] John Agudelo: \n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; I think that RM can start to integrate features reviwed by FTi don&#39;t think so\n[16:16:56] Mark Ostermann: would suggest to wait TT for review too\n[16:17:04] Mark Ostermann: then integrate\n[16:17:28] Steven: so what things can the TT look at now .. to get things started?\n[16:17:52] Mark Ostermann: @steven: all contribs that have FT review already\n[16:18:03] Mark Ostermann: would be fastest\n[16:18:16] Karsten Thiemann: and are available in public repositories..\n[16:18:22] Mark Ostermann: yepp\n[16:18:26] Steven: ok .. what can we see that falls in that category?\n[16:18:35] Steven: copy print format?\n[16:18:40] Steven: simple stuff\n[16:18:59] Steven: GL reconciliation ... been in producion use for some time.\n[16:19:11] Steven: things from others?\n[16:19:35] Victor Perez Juarez: what happens if the TT, not working, or not going as fast as we require\n[16:19:50] Steven: Mario.. have you reviewed thinsg that can now go to the TT?\n[16:20:01] Karsten Thiemann: if we want to speed up things the RM could start integrating a feature as soon as the reviewer finished the review without waiting for a technical team decision\n[16:20:18] Karsten Thiemann: @Victor: join the team\n[16:21:09] Mario Calderón: @Steven: I reviewed a many contribs, which are most OK from a functional point of view\n[16:21:21] Karsten Thiemann: but if the reviewer sees problems the RM needs to wait for the team decision\n[16:22:13 | Edited 16:22:24] Steven: @Karsten &quot;the reviewer&quot; functional or technical?\n[16:22:52] Victor Perez Juarez: @Karsten, my issue that the some contribution are from my company\n[16:22:54] Karsten Thiemann: technical\n[16:23:16] Victor Perez Juarez: then I only can give my comment the other contribution , in this case of Adaxa\n[16:23:31] Karsten Thiemann: a feature can be functional ok but breaks all ADempiere best practices for example\n[16:23:48] Tobias Schoeneberg: regarding this:\n[15:43] Victor Perez Juarez: \n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; Hi Mario/Victor,\n                           I am getting following error, when I am trying to push a new branch.
