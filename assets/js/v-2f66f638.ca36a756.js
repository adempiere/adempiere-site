At least we have not discussed this.\n[06:02:54] Paul Aviles: should it be a top priority?\n[06:04:20] Michael McKay: We will lose the history in doing so and Victor was quite invested in the git repository work.  If we can work around it, as we seem to be able to, the discussion was to leave it in two for now.\n[06:05:19] Paul Aviles: that is just part of the issue, too many repos and neither one is complete\n[06:06:52] Michael McKay: I&#39;m not sure a single repo would solve that...\n[06:07:20] Paul Aviles: but as a project having separate work is even worse, my two cents just wondering\n[06:07:52] Mario Calderón: I think that with the many branches we have, Adempiere is heavy for downloading it the first time. But the, when pulling just changes, it becomes lighter\n[06:08:20] Mario Calderón: ...or pulling just one branch\n[06:09:14] Michael McKay: Despite the difficulties, I don&#39;t think it is feasible to change before the 380 release.  Can we work around it in the short term?\n[06:10:05] Paul Aviles: let me see if I understand, we are really saying to anyone who wants to use or even test adempiere, go here download this, go there (if you even know that exist) and download that, mix it togehter and if lucky you have a working product?\n[06:13:09] Michael McKay: Yes - that is where we are.  Making it easy for new developers has not been a priority.  I fully support heading in that direction.\n[06:14:33] Paul Aviles: From any business or IT governance point of view this will not fly in any company. It will not kill anyone to delay any fixticions date for 380 and fix this now.\n[06:14:55] Paul Aviles: Just my humble opinion, it is one of the most challenging issues forever here\n[06:15:03] Michael McKay: Others?\n[06:15:28] Paul Aviles: Also Mike, this is not to make it easy for developers this is a business package at the end no?\n[06:15:59] Mario Calderón: I work with Mercurial and as I said, the first time takes its time, but afterwords it is manageable\n[06:16:16] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Non-technical people like me dont have a say in this technical stuff but what Paul says sounds sensible to me\n[06:17:42] Paul Aviles: As a CFO Steve nobody in the USA will allow this in any internal product, must less in a financial software which at the end is what and ERP is, it talks bold as to the lack of integration and maturity if the code.\n[06:19:35] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): As I said Paul what you said makes sense to me .. the matter was discussed at length ages ago and it was agreed to do what has been done .. if it was a bad decision then it needs to be reconsidered and either generally accepted or reversed.\n[06:20:17] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): either way .. has to be on the recommendation of the technical people\n[06:21:09] Paul Aviles: Just my opinion, dont usually get involved, but the servers requested for testing were completed last week and wanted to set them up. To my surprise I need to pull stuff from hg and some from a different in git, this is really silly.\n[06:21:37] Colin ROONEY: for users; they will download a binary most likely, for most companies I would expect that they create their  own repo for any code the put in production.\n[06:21:48] Paul Aviles: I need to know of the servers will be needed or not as so far nobody has done anything\n[06:21:56] Michael McKay: I&#39;m all for making the business package as simple as it needs to be.  A snapshot of the code, an install package for Windows, an AWS install script etc...  CLick here and get your instance, all properly configured, in the cloud in a few minutes.  Not sure these things relate to the repos, but they would help.\n[06:22:26] Colin ROONEY: I thought Victor was going to set up your servers Paul\n[06:22:35] Michael McKay: I&#39;d like to have access to setup the SAHI testing.\n[06:22:53] Paul Aviles: Hey Colin, I guess my appearance today wil say otherwise\n[06:23:26] Paul Aviles: need to go guys so pleasse email me (i think everyone has my email) if anyone can do this\n[06:23:43] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): thanks Paul\n[06:23:47] Colin ROONEY: bye Paul.. thanks for the help!\n[06:24:10] Paul Aviles: the servers are up and so far only one person from Adaxa.au requested access\n[06:24:18] Paul Aviles: meaning nobody else except me has..\n[06:24:26] Paul Aviles: meaning nothing else has been done\n[06:24:34] Paul Aviles: meaning ...\n[06:24:37] Paul Aviles: just that\n[06:24:37] Paul Aviles: bye all\n[06:24:41] Mario Calderón: thanks Paul\n[06:26:48] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Some time back there was a question about what domains mght be used for our test instances.  We suggested using the adempiere.com.au and .net.au if no one had better suggestions.  Jacken has been corresponding with Paul to get that stuff set up .. that why Paul is saying he had contact from AU.\n[06:27:46] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I was assuming that the actual machines would be set up and configured by others hence my email a few days back but have heard nothing ... what is next steps and wh needs to perform them?\n[06:29:52] Mario Calderón: Victor has to tell us what&#39;s been done, but he&#39;s not attending\n[06:30:21] Mario Calderón: I can ask him to deliver a status and prepare the servers\n[06:30:27] Mario Calderón: tasks\n[06:30:35] Mario Calderón: 1.- prepare night build\n[06:30:43] Mario Calderón: more? (Mike)\n[06:32:41] Michael McKay: Following the build, run the tests and report. - Its all part of the Jenkins or Hudson setup.  The key part that I don&#39;t have experience with is the setup of these services and the setup of the supporting software.  Need someone with experience to help here.\n[06:33:15] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Suman .. any suggestions?\n[06:34:38] Mario Calderón: @Steven: copied\n[06:35:22] Michael McKay: Have to step out - I&#39;ll be back and forth over the next hour.\n[06:35:50] Mario Calderón: bye\n[06:35:55] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): bye Mike\n[06:36:29] Michael McKay: Not going - just have to leave for minutes at a time. I&#39;ll be slow in response.\n[06:36:29] suman ravuri: Hi Mike\n[06:36:37] suman ravuri: we can help you\n[06:37:13] Mario Calderón: ca you do the configuration Suman?\n[06:37:37] Yamel Senih: Hi\n[06:37:41] suman ravuri: I can setup jenkins\n[06:37:52] Mario Calderón: hi Yamel\n[06:37:59] Mario Calderón: I&#39;d say then just contact Paul for accessing it...\n[06:37:59] suman ravuri: can install required supporting softwares\n[06:39:40] Michael McKay: Great.  I&#39;m making a few changes to the Sahi code and will update the AdempiereTestSuite in a few days.  That repo can be added to the nightly build and a particular script run to perform the tests on the ZK interface.\n[06:40:08] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Suman, do you have Paul&#39;s email?\n[06:40:49] suman ravuri: I need to check Steve\n[06:41:14] Mario Calderón: we can send it to you privately\n[06:41:24] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): just sent it to you\n[06:42:23] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): @Suman, can you please write to Pul today and get the install underway?\n[06:42:32] suman ravuri: yes\n[06:43:48] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): so when can we plan to have the sw on the machines and make them publicly avaiable for testing?\n[06:44:21] suman ravuri: give me 2 days max\n[06:44:44] suman ravuri: once I get access will be able to do it in 4 hours\n[06:45:14] Mario Calderón: great!\n[06:45:35] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): that will be a big step forward\n[06:47:23] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I assume that will provide the two pre-built test instances .. and providing access to the underlying code and build instructions is a next step?\n[06:47:45] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): what is involved for that part to happen?\n[06:48:31] Michael McKay: That should be part of the setup of Jenkins, if I understand.\n[06:49:57] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ..who will be performing that part of the process?\n[06:50:52] suman ravuri: @Mike, I can get jenkins installed\n[06:53:31] Michael McKay: Good and Thanks.  If you could ensure it provides the items Steve mentioned, it would be appreciated.\n[06:53:49] Michael McKay: Got to go for a longer time now.  Back in 20 minutes.\n[06:55:19] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Suman,  I hope you make good progress on this .. can you keep us advised by email rather than wait to next meeting. If there are any hold-ups then please let us know as soon as possible\n[06:56:42] suman ravuri: Ok Steve\n[06:57:37] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): as I recall the other matter was the program to assist with testing costing engine .. I assume that waits till after this set up stuff?\n[06:58:34] suman ravuri: @Steve, we are yet to conculde design on ti\n[06:58:38] suman ravuri: it\n[06:59:03] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): any other matters to be raised?\n[06:59:49] Mario Calderón: just the test page\n[06:59:59] Mario Calderón: I will contact Karsten to finish it\n[07:00:31] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): thanks ... does that include some help to testers about where and how to log issues?\n[07:01:18] Mario Calderón: yes...\n[07:01:23] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): thanks\n[07:01:48] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): anything anyone wants to raise?\n[07:02:45] Mario Calderón: not from my side\n[07:03:03] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok .. lets finish up\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div>',11)],s={},l=(0,n(42272).c)(s,[["render",function(e,i){return(0,t.Wz)(),(0,t.An)("div",null,a)}]])},19900:(e,i,n)=>{n.r(i),n.d(i,{data:()=>t});const t=JSON.parse('{"key":"v-2f66f638","path":"/community/wiki/meetings/FT-2014/FT-20140128.html","title":"FT/TT meeting minutes January 28th 2014","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"FT/TT meeting minutes January 28th 2014","category":"Community","star":9,"sticky":9,"tag":["Wiki","Meetings"],"article":false,"description":"Meeting Minutes General Moderator: Steven Sackett Secretary: Mario Calderon Participants: Steven Sackett, Mike McKay, Mario Calderon, Suman Ravuri, Colin Rooney, Paul Aviles Date / Time: January 28th, 2014 / 12:00h -
