Anyone else here yet?\n[06:05:45] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): not yet\n[06:05:47] Trifon Trifonov: hi everyone\n[06:05:53] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): hi Trifon\n[06:06:13] Michael McKay: I&#39;ll be in and out for the next 20 minutes.\n[06:07:55] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): anyone know who else may be attending?\n[06:09:40] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): for the record .. minutes of lastmeeting from Mario are here.   http://www.adempiere.com/FT/TT_meeting_minutes_October_15th_2013\n[06:11:54] Mario Calderón: hallo\n[06:12:13] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Hi Mario\n[06:12:28] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): This was Mario&#39;s summary of last meeting for reference ....Agenda\n\nMinutes of Previous Meeting\n\nActions taken by RM\n\nTechnical team reviews\n\nFunctional Team reviews\n\nActions to be taken\n\nMisc\n\nNext meeting\n\nMinutes of Previous Meeting\n\nhttp://www.adempiere.com/FT/TT_meeting_minutes_October_8th_2013\n\nActions taken by RM\n\npostgres 9.3 is integrated\n\nSmartJSP report improvments inprogress\n\nProcess Gear in Window Integrated\n\nAutocomplete Integrated\n\nTechnical team reviews\n\nnot any announced\n\nFunctional team reviews\n\nnot any announced\n\nMisc\n\nProblems with updating repository\n\nOn windows\n\nProblem solved (https://sourceforge.net/p/adempiere/discussion/610548/thread/502bc2e3/)\n\nStill, there might be people who face the problem, but ignore the solution\n\nA page should be written, explaining the problem and the solution (not any responsible appointed)\n\nProblems with Metas&#39; contrbutions: seems that merging from original branches was wrong. Victor will help RM to overcome this.\n\nTask on RM: to get the repository stable so tests can begin\n[06:13:37] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Are we ready to start?\n[06:13:43] Mario Calderón: yes\n[06:14:00] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): we need s moderator ... volunteers?\n[06:14:14] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): we need a secretry .. volunteers?\n[06:14:40] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Mario .. will u be sec?\n[06:15:02] Mario Calderón: +1\n[06:15:52] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): in the absence of any other candidate :-(   I will be moderator?\n[06:16:06] Mario Calderón: :) you&#39;re the chosen\n[06:16:55] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok .. the main issue in the last meeting was related to git and mercurial .. we really need Victor to be part of any discussion on that matter however..\n[06:17:38] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): we have Mike here hopefully .. who has been exploring the issue with new eyes and has written up some notes for guidance in the wiki.\n[06:18:31] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I would like Mike to  let us know his thoughts\n[06:18:46] Mario Calderón: if not, he could put his observations here when he bounces back?\n[06:20:16] Michael McKay: First, the main thing is to keep the processes as simple as possible so that developers can contribute without frustration and problems.  Both HG and Git are designed to do their job simply.  The issue is getting them to work together simply.\n[06:21:52] Michael McKay: On windows, the issue for me seemed to be Mercurial versions &lt;= 2.7.1. The recent 2.7.2 version works well and has solved the issues.  I can now update to pre git revesions and back to the tip without issues.  I have not tried commits to the git repo yet.\n[06:22:22] Mario Calderón: so your recommendation?\n[06:22:52] Michael McKay: I&#39;m not sure if others have problems and I&#39;d like to know Suman&#39;s experience and issues - are they still holding things up.\n[06:23:18] suman ravuri: Hi Mike, have you tried switching between repos?\n[06:23:38] suman ravuri: I mean branches?\n[06:24:11] Michael McKay: Yes.  I can move around and update normally and the git is removed or added without issue.\n[06:25:12] suman ravuri: did you try with simple commit?\n[06:25:24] suman ravuri: after switching braches\n[06:25:45] Michael McKay: No.  I can do so later this morning.  Is that where you are having issues?\n[06:26:13] suman ravuri: yes\n[06:26:35] suman ravuri: I need to manually remove and add git repos manually\n[06:26:53] suman ravuri: I am using older version of hg\n[06:26:57] suman ravuri: that could be the problem\n[06:29:16] suman ravuri: I will upgrade hg and verify once\n[06:29:44] Michael McKay: 2.7.2 fixed the error of invalid handles that was preventing updates.  It works on the command line, but not with TortoiseHG - there I have to use the command line version.\n[06:30:33] suman ravuri: I am using tortoisehg to simply integration work\n[06:30:51] suman ravuri: sourcetree is also started working in windows\n[06:31:28] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): so, what is next steps?\n[06:31:49] suman ravuri: if sourcetree can work with latest hg then that can be one good option\n[06:32:15] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): when can that be tested?\n[06:32:49] suman ravuri: I will get this tested tomorrow from my end\n[06:34:37] Michael McKay: I&#39;m my opinion, removing git now will be difficult.  If we can get the CM software to work (including both hg and git) in a simple fashion, we should proceed.  Undoing the hg repo at this point will be a major challenge.\n[06:35:35] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Suman, your view? assuming it can be made to work as Mike outlined?\n[06:36:40] suman ravuri: let me try with new hg and then I will be able to comment\n[06:37:04] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok .. lets leave this till after some more testing .. agreed?\n[06:37:12] Mario Calderón: ok\n[06:37:38] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Suman, can you update us on what has been done in the last week please.\n[06:38:09] suman ravuri: 1. Manufacturing Light separate branch(ADEMPIERE-216-ManufacturingLite) creation and committed the changes. - Done\n\n2. Deepak&#39;s SmartJSP report changes integration - Done\n\n3. Migration fixes of Smart Report and CurrencyExchange - Done\n\n4. Configurable dashboards - Inprogress\n\n\n\nWaiting for metas to fix the process gear which has unnecessary code changes and wrong migration scripts?If metas can not fix in certain time, we may need to revert the changes\n[06:39:05] Victor Perez Juarez: So i think that we need Switch to git but can be after 380\n[06:39:12] Mario Calderón: ok copied\n[06:39:25] Mario Calderón: hi Victor\n[06:40:30] Victor Perez Juarez: Hi\n[06:40:40] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): @Suman, are you waiting for feedback from someone at Metas?\n[06:40:58] suman ravuri: I sent mail to Cristina\n[06:40:59] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): hi Victor..\n[06:41:04] Michael McKay: One last point - Suman - try the thg.exe version of TortoiseHG instead of the thgw.exe version.   The former is working for me.  (TortoiseHG version 2.9.2 with mercurial 2.7.2.)\n[06:41:22] suman ravuri: I expecting resposnse from her\n[06:42:05] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): How long can you leave it to get some fixes?\n[06:42:07]

gear I waiting for metas\n[06:43:28] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I would like to test the smartjsp changes .. is there somewhere i can connect to to see them?\n[06:43:52] Victor Perez Juarez: Yes because now not is posible generare a seed\n[06:44:28] suman ravuri: http://adempiere.walkingtree.in/admin\n[06:44:32] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): thanks\n[06:45:23] Victor Perez Juarez: Suman i not see here of cash flow menu\n[06:45:24] suman ravuri: can we request Metas if they can fix it\n[06:45:43] Victor Perez Juarez: I think that sql is missed\n[06:46:36] suman ravuri: I will check this and get back to you\n[06:47:14] Victor Perez Juarez: What was conclusión can then add WM as other git sub repository ?\n[06:48:35] suman ravuri: as Mike tested it seems it works well with latest hg\n[06:48:43] suman ravuri: version\n[06:48:58] suman ravuri: so I am ok to add this feature\n[06:49:08] Victor Perez Juarez: Ok\n[06:49:13] Mario Calderón: (whew)\n[06:49:35] suman ravuri: :)\n[06:50:12] Victor Perez

Steven Sackett (Adaxa): like the idea .. not tried to test it ..\n[06:51:38] Victor Perez Juarez: nice i think should integrate smart browse this way will be complete solution\n[06:51:38] Mario Calderón: +1\n[06:51:54] Victor Perez Juarez: +1\n[06:53:05] suman ravuri: yes\n[06:53:33] suman ravuri: Integrating smart browser with configurable dashboard would be ideal solution\n[06:53:38] suman ravuri: I will try to get this in place\n[06:53:50] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I know we want to get quickly to a release ready for testing but there is also code for ZK versions of delete entities and GL Reconciliation and prettying up the html reports .. do people want these added?\n[06:54:01] Victor Perez Juarez: Should be posible show SB in Dashboard\n[06:54:46] suman ravuri: [6:24:42 PM] Steven:  prettying up the html reports\n\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; is done\n[06:54:53] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): good\n[06:55:01] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): thanks\n[06:55:12] Mario Calderón: +1\n[06:55:45] suman
