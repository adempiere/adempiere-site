The process follows these steps:</p><ul><li>Identification: A user identifies an issue and, depending on the experience of the user, will either discuss the issue in a Source Forge forum or enter the issue in the JIRA Issue Tracker. If the issue is discussed in the forums and other people confirm the issue as a problem, then it should be entered into the Issue - Tracker. (Don&#39;t assume this will happen automatically. If you get involved in the discussion, please ensure the issue is entered in JIRA.)</li><li>Issue Types: An issue can be a bug report but it can also be a new feature request or improvement to the system.</li><li>Triage: once the issue is entered in JIRA, it will be triaged by the technical team to assess the nature of the problem. When the issue is first entered, set the status to Triage Pending to trigger this process. The technical team will change the status and priority of the issue once the triage is complete. If the status is set to Open, a developer will be assigned to address the problem. Open: An open issue is ready to be worked on.</li><li>In Progress: While the developer is working on the issue, the status will be set to In Progress</li><li>Resolved: When a solution is determined, the issue is marked Resolved.</li><li>Commit: Once the issue is resolved, the modified software will be committed to the source repository according to the Software Development Procedure. Details of the commit are typically included in the resolution message in the Issue Tracker. The process is not linear and the issue status can move back and forth or jump steps as required.

It is critically important that users and developers identify and communicate the issues they find as only known issues will have a chance at resolution. Once issues are identified, the resolution of the issues will improve the quality of the software in a continuous cycle.</p><p>The <a href="a">Software Development Procedure</a> outlines the methods used to collect and publish the issue solutions. In short, there are main releases of the software which are packaged and intended for production use. In between these releases, a series of patches may be published that will further improve the software quality. The most resent release and the associated patches represent the best quality in the project.</p>',11),m={},f=(0,i(3860).Z)(m,[["render",function(e,t){const i=(0,s.up)("RouterLink"),m=(0,s.up)("ExternalLinkIcon");return(0,s.wg)(),(0,s.iD)("div",null,[r,(0,s._)("p",null,[o,(0,s.Wm)(i,{to:"/community/wiki/preface/quality-assurance-and-problem-reporting-guidelines/getting-involved-in-qa.html"},{default:(0,s.w5)((()=>[a])),_:1}),n]),l,(0,s._)("p",null,[u,(0,s._)("a",h,[c,(0,s.Wm)(m)]),d]),p])}]])},2341:(e,t,i)=>{i.r(t),i.d(t,{data:()=>s});const s=JSON.parse('{"key":"v-af49ef40","path":"/community/wiki/preface/quality-assurance-and-problem-reporting-guidelines/the-quality-assurance-process.html","title":"The Quality Assurance Process","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"The Quality Assurance Process","category":["Community"],"star":9,"sticky":9,"tag":["Preface","Community"],"article":false,"summary":"The QA Process The Quality Assurance Process for ADempiere The goal of Quality Assurance (QA) for ADempiere is to ensure that the released software is stable, that known bugs and l","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere-site.github.io/community/wiki/preface/quality-assurance-and-problem-reporting-guidelines/the-quality-assurance-process.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"The Quality Assurance Process"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2023-08-04T19:42:13.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale:alternate","content":"es-ES"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"Preface"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"Community"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2023-08-04T19:42:13.000Z"}]]},"excerpt":"","headers":[{"level":2,"title":"The Quality Assurance Process for ADempiere","slug":"the-quality-assurance-process-for-adempiere","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Who is Involved?","slug":"who-is-involved","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"The Issue Reporting Process","slug":"the-issue-reporting-process","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Entering an Issue","slug":"entering-an-issue","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Software Quality","slug":"software-quality","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1691178133000,"updatedTime":1691178133000,"contributors":[{"name":"Jesús Albujas","email":"134967453+tecnicoerp@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":3.47,"words":1041},"filePathRelative":"community/wiki/preface/quality-assurance-and-problem-reporting-guidelines/the-quality-assurance-process.md","localizedDate":"August 4, 2023"}')}}]);
