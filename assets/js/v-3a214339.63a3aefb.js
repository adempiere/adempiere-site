However with this comes increased responsibility.</p><h3 id="users" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#users" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Users</h3><p>Users are the people who use the products that the Project produces. People in this role aren&#39;t contributing code, but they are using the products, reporting bugs, and making feature requests and suggestions. Users are encouraged to participate through the user newsgroup(s), asking questions, providing suggestions, and helping other users. Users are also encouraged to report problem reports using the bug tracking system.</p><h3 id="developers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#developers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Developers</h3><p>Users who contribute code or documentation become developers. Developers are the people who contribute code, fixes, documentation, or other work that goes into the product. Developers are also encouraged to participate in the user newsgroup(s), and should monitor the developer mailing list associated with their area of contribution. When appropriate, developers may also contribute to development design discussions related to their area of contribution. Developers are expected to be proactive in reporting problems in the bug tracking system.</p><h3 id="committers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#committers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Committers</h3><p>Developers who give frequent and valuable contributions to a Project, or component of a Project (in the case of large Projects), can have their status promoted to that of a &quot;Committer&quot; for that Project or component respectively. A Committer has write access to the source code repository for the associated Project (or component), and gains voting rights allowing them to affect the future of the Project (or component).</p><p>In order for a Developer to become a Committer on a particular Project overseen by the PMC, another Committer for the same Project (or component as appropriate) can nominate that Developer or the Developer can ask to be nominated. Once a Developer is nominated, the Committers for the Project (or component) will vote. If there are at least 3 positive votes and no negative votes, the Developer is recommended to the PMC for commit privileges. If the PMC also approves, the Developer is converted into a Committer and given write access to the source code repository for that Project (or component). Becoming a Committer is a privilege that is earned by contributing and showing discipline and good judgement. It is a responsibility that should be neither given nor taken lightly.</p><p>At times, Committers may go inactive for a variety of reasons. The decision making process of the Project relies on active committers who respond to discussions and votes in a constructive and timely manner. The PMC is responsible for ensuring the smooth operation of the Project. A Committer that is disruptive, does not participate actively, or has been inactive for an extended period may have his or her commit status removed by the PMC.</p><p>Active participation in the user newsgroup and the appropriate developer mailing lists is a responsibility of all Committers, and is critical to the success of the Project. Committers are required to monitor and contribute to the user newsgroup.</p><p>Committers are required to monitor the developer mailing list associated with all Projects and components for which they have commit privileges. This is a condition of being granted commit rights to the Project or component. It is mandatory because committers must participate in votes (which in some cases require a certain minimum number of votes) and must respond to the mailing list in a timely fashion in order to facilitate the smooth operation of the Project. When a Committer is granted commit rights they will be added to the appropriate mailing lists. A Committer must not be unsubscribed from a developer mailing list unless their associated commit privileges are also removed.</p><p>Committers are required to track, participate in, and vote on, relevant discussions in their associated Projects and components. There are three voting responses: +1 (yes), -1 (no, or veto), and 0 (abstain).</p><p>Committers are responsible for proactively reporting problems in the bug tracking system, and annotating problem reports with status information, explanations, clarifications, or requests for more information from the submitter. Committers are responsible for updating problem reports when they have done work related to the problem.</p><h2 id="projects" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#projects" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Projects</h2><p>The work under this Top Level Project is further organized into Projects. New Projects must be significant works consistent with the mission of the Top Level Project, be recommended by the PMC, and confirmed by the EMO. Projects can be discontinued by decision of the Board.</p><p>When a new Project is created, the PMC nominates a Project lead to act as the technical leader and nominates the initial set of Committers for the Project, and these nominations are approved by the EMO. Project leads are accountable to the PMC for the success of their Project.</p><h3 id="project-components" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#project-components" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Project Components</h3><p>The PMC may decide to divide a Project further into components. If a Project is divided into components, commit privileges are normally granted at the component level, and the committers for a given component vote on issues specific to that component. Components are established and discontinued by the PMC. When the PMC creates a component it appoints a component lead to act as the technical leader and names the initial set of Committers for the component. The component lead is designated as a committer for the Project and represents the component in discussions and votes pertaining to the Project as a whole. Component Committers do not participate in votes at the level of the Project as a whole, unless they are also the component lead.</p><h3 id="ports" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ports" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ports</h3><p>For components that contain platform-specific code (such as SWT), it may be advantageous to allow developers to work on a port of the component to a new platform without requiring that they already be committers for the component. In this case the main code base is known as the component &quot;core&quot;, and the port code base is known as a component &quot;port&quot;. The decision to set up a port is made by the PMC. When a new port of a component is created, the PMC appoints a Port Lead, and an initial set of committers who will have commit and voting privileges specifically for the port. The port is done under the auspices of the core component, and all committers for the core component automatically also have commit and voting privileges on the port. Normally the Component Lead will also be the Port Lead.</p><h3 id="infrastructure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#infrastructure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Infrastructure</h3><p>The PMC works with the EMO to ensure the required infrastructure for the Project. The Project infrastructure will include, at minimum:</p><p>Bug Database - Bugzilla database for tracking bugs and feature requests. Source Repository -- One or more CVS repositories containing both the master source code and documentation for the Projects. Website - A website will contain information about the Project, including documentation, downloads of releases, and this Charter. General Mailing List - Mailing list for development discussions pertaining to the Project as a whole or that cross Projects. This mailing list is open to the public. Project Mailing Lists - Development mailing list for technical discussions related to the Project. This mailing list is open to the public. Component Mailing Lists -- Development mailing list for technical discussions related to the component. This mailing list is open to the public. The Development Process Each Project lead must produce a development plan for the release cycle, and the development plan must be approved by the PMC and by a majority of Committers of the Project.</p><p>Each Project must identify, and make available on its web site, the requirements and prioritizations it is working against in the current release cycle. In addition, each Project must post a release plan showing the date and content of the next major release, including any major milestones, and must keep this plan up to date.</p><p>The Committers of a Project or component decide which changes may be committed to the master code base of a Project or component respectively. Three +1 (&#39;yes&#39; votes) with no -1 (&#39;no&#39; votes or vetoes) are needed to approve a code change. Vetoes must be followed by an explanation for the veto within 24 hours or the veto becomes invalid. All votes are conducted via the developer mailing list associated with the Project or component.</p><p>Special rules may be established by the PMC for Projects or components with fewer than three Committers. For efficiency, some code changes from some contributors (e.g. feature additions, bug fixes) may be approved in advance, or approved in principle based on an outline of the work, in which case they may be committed first and changed as needed, with conflicts resolved by majority vote of the Committers of the Project or component, as applicable. More restrictive rules for releasing changes may be established by the PMC near the end of release cycles or for maintenance streams.</p><p>The master copy of the code base must reside on the Project web site where it is accessible to all users, developers and committers. Committers must check their changes and new work into the master code base as promptly as possible (subject to any check-in voting rules that may be in effect) in order to foster collaboration among widely distributed groups and so that the latest work is always available to everyone. The PMC is responsible for working with the Eclipse Foundation to establish a release engineering and build process to ensure that builds can be reliably produced on a regular and frequent basis from the master code base and made available for download from the Project web site.</p><p>The PMC is responsible for establishing the level of testing appropriate for each Project, and approving the test plans.</p><p>All development technical discussions are conducted using the development mailing lists. If discussions are held offline, then a summary must be posted to the mailing list to keep the other committers informed.</p><h3 id="licensing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#licensing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Licensing</h3><p>All contributions to Projects under this Charter must adhere to the ADempiere Project Intellectual Property Policy.</p><h2 id="part-ii" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#part-ii" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Part II</h2><p>(hereby continuing original work of ADempiere Council..)</p><p><strong>Community Process</strong> (todo)</p><p><strong>ADempiereForge Strategy</strong> During the initial stage of forking, the strategy of source codes committed to our SourceForge is to maintain the present latest versions in use by Compiere users such as 253b where bug fixes are done and committed to SVN.</p><p>Other variants or forks of Compiere are housed as separate projects according to their respective owners.
