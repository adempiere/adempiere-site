These settings can then be easily reapplied if necessary.</li><li>Ability to distribute custom .java source code for any user-defined custom functionality such as callouts and functions. This includes the ability to replace or add new .java files or snippets of code. Any original code that is changed is automatically backed up before applying the custom code. The code can be returned to the original state if required by using the package rollback feature as described above.</li><li>Import packages directly while in Adempiere.

It can be as simple as a \n          report or as complex as an entire Manufacturing Module. \n\n    2. Using 2Pack:\n\n     2.1. Create the package:\n\n       2.1.1. Complete the Package Details. Automatically listed are all the common objects to be                     \n              included in a package as defined in the first step. Also enter the additional \n              objects necessary to transfer the customization to other instances. Such as the \n              application or module, a window, or table, selection of master or transactional data\n              or custom code files or code snippets. When all details have been entered its time \n              to generate the package. Simply click the generate button on the head window.\n\n     2.2. Share the package:\n\n       2.2.1. When the package is generated, two compressed files are created, one in a .zip                   \n              format and the other in a tar.gz format. These files contain the complete code \n              necessary to build and install the customization on any Adempiere installation. \n              Simply distribute these files to your targeted user.\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><h2 id="the-anatomy-of-a-package" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-anatomy-of-a-package" aria-hidden="true">#</a> The Anatomy of a Package</h2><div class="language-text ext-text line-numbers-mode"><pre class="language-text"><code>Definition: A package is a self-contained set of files that allow a user&#39;s customization to be \ntransferred from one Adempiere instance to another Adempiere instance.The following is a detail\nlook at the layout of a package as created by 2Pack.\n \n         1. {Adempieresource}/packages/{package name}/ Contains the user executed files that \n            launch the Ant build process or generates the model files. The build.xml file controls\n            the Ant build process as well as contains the necessary connection settings for the \n            Adempiere database. \n              • Build.xml – Ant build file to control that controls the package build process \n              • RUN_build (.sh and .bat) – User executable that starts the build process\n              • GenerateModel (.sh and .bat) – User executable that starts the build process for \n                the model files.\n              • OSLabs.gif – Splash screen graphics for build process. (Replace with your own) \n        2.{Adempieresource}/packages/{package name}/lib Contains the jar files for the package. \n        3.{Adempieresource}/packages/{package name}/dict This directory has one file, \n          AdempiereAD.xml. This file contains all the necessary data dictionary settings to create\n          the module as well as how and where the files in the /dist will be copied. \n        4.{Adempieresource}/packages/{package name}/dist/{version} Contains all .java files to be \n          distributed to Adempiere’s source code as well as other files, such as templates, images\n          or other documents. \n        5.{Adempieresource}/packages/{package name}/doc This directory contains the install \n          instructions generated by Pack In. It also contains the installation logs created during\n          the installation of the package. \n        6.{Adempieresource}/packages/{package name}/backup This directory is created during the \n          original installation of the package. This directory will backup any files overridden \n          during the installation process.
