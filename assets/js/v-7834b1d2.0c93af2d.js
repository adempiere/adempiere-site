I had a message from Paul A asking about setting up test systems on Nickel Networks.  I can ask Jacken to follow up with Paul to provide the dns info tomorrow.  Paul asks what we want set up.\n[06:18:47] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Is testing normally done separately on postgres and oracle?\n[06:19:15] Mario Calderón: yes\n[06:19:15] suman ravuri: yes\n[06:19:20] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): if so do we need systems running each?\n[06:19:30] Mario Calderón: yes\n[06:20:13] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): shall we proceed with Paul&#39;s offer straight away?\n[06:20:28] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): rather than wait to hear from ADeV?\n[06:20:41] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): or wait for ADev?\n[06:22:01] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I hope we can get test instances up immediately .. this is taking too long.\n[06:24:02] Mario Calderón: I think it can be dealt quickly\n[06:24:15] Mario Calderón: we can set this week as limit\n[06:24:30] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok with me .. Suman?\n[06:25:42] suman ravuri: I am fine with Paul&#39;s offer\n[06:27:10] Colin ROONEY: Happy new year all - great work these last months!  Last time Paul provided us a system it was very fast!  And he had scripts to update to trunk every night - it could only be a plus I would have thought\n[06:27:37] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): hi Colin, good to hear from you.\n[06:28:10] Mario Calderón: hi Colin, Happy New Year!\n\nThen we go right: we ask ADeV and Paul is a good alternative\n[06:28:20] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok\n[06:28:31] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): any other matters from anyone?\n[06:28:55] Mario Calderón: when do we start community testing?\n[06:30:03] suman ravuri: as soon as machine is ready, I may need few hours of time to setup the server\n[06:30:26] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I guess there are two parts to that .. non technical people like me are waiting for test instances to be available with reasonable performance so testing is not too painful.  I assume technical people need to be able to install their own version?\n[06:30:49] Mario Calderón: if there is a build, yes...\n[06:31:14] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Is everything that technically competent people need to set up and build their own instance in place?\n[06:31:51] suman ravuri: yes Steve\n[06:32:32] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I assume we need to get the oracle and postgres test instances in place, advertise them and ask for testing?\n[06:32:48] Colin ROONEY: is victors github repo now part of the main repo or does one still need to do a little magic to merge them?  I actually tried to create a test env for myself but failed.  That was months ago now mind.\n[06:33:15] suman ravuri: Still we need to follow few more steps\n[06:33:30] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Is there a document to guide people trying to do what Colin was trying?\n[06:33:55] suman ravuri: I have shared one document and Mike prepared another one\n[06:33:59] suman ravuri: either would work\n[06:34:04] Mario Calderón: we need a page for removing bugs\n[06:34:34] Colin ROONEY: I will cehck out out - my system in being repaired right now as soon as I get it ack I will try to create a new development env from scratch and see how I get on\n[06:34:37] Colin ROONEY: thx\n[06:34:39] Mario Calderón: and for testing modules, like in the last release. I will look at the page\n[06:35:24] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): will we be logging bug reports etc on Sourceforge? or do we have to learn something else beforehand?\n[06:36:24] Colin ROONEY: I had thought Jira was the logging tool of choice for the project these days?\n[06:36:43] suman ravuri: in JIRA, we added few documents for most of features we integrated\n[06:37:11] suman ravuri: those documents can be used as reference\n[06:37:15] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): how do people without aJira account get one? (I have one)\n[06:37:45] suman ravuri: I think they can signup\n[06:38:22] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): so its all simple and should cause no problems?  and there will be guidance in our document?\n[06:38:51] Mario Calderón: Teo Sarca is our JIRA Admin\n[06:39:20] Mario Calderón: this should be straight -if you are a developer, you solve more difficult things\n[06:39:41] Victor Perez Juarez: Hi jira is simple\n[06:40:03] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): sure, but please consider users who are not technical and who are trying to help with testing .. its not so clear to them.\n[06:40:17] Victor Perez Juarez: You can create a user and post\n[06:40:40] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): well if it is that simple it should not take much effort to document it.\n[06:40:50] Colin ROONEY: :D\n[06:40:56] Colin ROONEY: check mate\n[06:41:16] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): otherwise you will just have people like me sending emails to Mario and Suman!\n[06:41:50] Victor Perez Juarez: So for posting bug i think we need of user name\n[06:41:56] Mario Calderón: ok, then somebody has to document how to get a JIRA account\n[06:43:23] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I had only one other thing I wanted to mention.. we are looking at writing a program to update GW data..\n[06:43:27] Victor Perez Juarez: Is as any register page\n[06:43:34] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): wanted to check people ok with a suggestion\n[06:44:26] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): the most recent trx in GW seem to be &gt;8 years old. Plan is to add all years up to say 2015.\n[06:44:32] Victor Perez Juarez: About of install of new instance in Paul server not is issue i can\n[06:45:12] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): find every date in the system and add 8 years to it.  reset any period_id to the period containing the new date.\n[06:45:22] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): delete the ancient years and periods.\n[06:45:49] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): as it would be a java program it would update either database type.\n[06:46:09] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): it would be a program not a migration script.  any other suggestions?\n[06:46:51] Mario Calderón: I would support Steven&#39;s suggestion\n[06:47:45] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): question is whether this can be used to update the seed database or whether everyone who wants it should just run the program?\n[06:48:29] Victor Perez Juarez: So more easy is use applicarion dictonary we need read All tablea with a date and add year a and this for all\n[06:49:33] Victor Perez Juarez: When we finish only export new seed\n[06:49:33] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): pls explain that more..\n[06:50:34] Mario Calderón: can this be managed at a technical level? The goal is to have the GW data from 2013 backwards, isn&#39;t it?\n[06:50:44] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): yes.\n[06:51:26] Victor Perez Juarez: We need suman make a main class that read All applicarion dictonary and found All entity that management dates\n[06:51:55] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): what I was being warned about was new installs can just take the new seed database all nicely updated .. what about existing sites.. wont they need either a program or a script to achieve same?\n[06:52:30] suman ravuri: I can the program in place\n[06:52:38] suman ravuri: have\n[06:52:50] Victor Perez Juarez: Then can use Genéric class Po to read All récord for each entity and add 10 year\n[06:53:00] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): so, do we continue with what we started?\n[06:54:13] Mario Calderón: we were at JIRA\n[06:54:13] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): or does someone else want the task?\n[06:54:51] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): and?\n[06:55:10] Mario Calderón: did we finish JIRA?\n[06:55:31] Mario Calderón: sb had to document how to get an account...\n[06:56:07] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): any other matters to be raised?\n[06:56:46] Michael McKay: Hi all,  I can document the testing process and JIRA in the wiki.\n[06:57:18] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Hi Mike .. that would help people like me.\n[06:58:14] Mario Calderón: hi Mike, Happy New Year\n[06:58:31] Victor Perez Juarez: I have create demo data for my new créate functionality\n[06:58:55] Victor Perez Juarez: Payroll &amp; mfg\n[06:59:46] Victor Perez Juarez: Think that we need got other functionality\n[06:59:59] Michael McKay: @Victor, can you send me rough info of how these processes work? I&#39;d like to use SAHI to test them as well.\n[07:00:29] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Was payroll added to the 380 roadmap?\n[07:00:56] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I thought it would added after 380?\n[07:02:27] Victor Perez Juarez: Mi idea is creste ademiere tv Chanel in vimeo for now in spanish and Mario can help with translation it is a good way of document add to wiki\n[07:03:35] Steven

demo\n[07:04:41] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): your plan is to add demo data, not additional code and functionality?\n[07:05:34] Victor Perez Juarez: Yes only data demo\n[07:05:56] suman ravuri: I too have same understanding\n[07:05:59] Victor Perez Juarez: Of people as me for an demo info\n[07:06:20] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): demo data is always good to have.\n[07:06:53] Victor Perez Juarez: But we need

adding?\n[07:08:08] Victor Perez Juarez: @Mike we can create a document scrip and use this to creste to créate sahi test\n[07:08:23] Victor Perez Juarez: Cash flow\n[07:08:33] Steven Sackett (Adaxa):
