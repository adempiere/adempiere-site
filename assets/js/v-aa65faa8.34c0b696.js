For example, if we want to explorre with a Payroll module, the final figures accounts posting can be done via the default accounts-id schmea in the Business Partner Cateogry and inducted into the present Accounts Payable model (Invoice of expenses, in this case - wages). Other regulartory fitures or books have to be reviewd during accounts posting, whether coding flows are correct. All said, that reuse point may be the 90% headache! If you do not integrate and link your own suite then your codes are out of the architecture and much of the features of the architecture such as security, access control, user preferences, window design and report generation may be lost from your separated codes. For experts, you can follow the pattern of Adempiere codes to create different functional modules.</p><h2 id="database-sql" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#database-sql" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Database &amp; SQL</h2><ul><li>What must be done after altering source code or SQL Queries?</li></ul><p>We must compile and rebuild the code before such changes can take affect by executing RUN_build.sh.</p><ul><li>What is important to understand about debugging SQL in Adempiere?</li></ul><p>&quot;There is significant source in the form of independent SQL procedures, views, triggers, and functions that exist at the database level. As a result of moving away from Oracle, the triggers have been removed from the database domain and put into the source code domain, as of version 251d. The trigger code is now part of the model classes. The base class for all of them PO, provides a method called beforeSave(). This method is called when save() is called on any derivate of PO. Final model classes can implement this method to perform any &quot;&quot;trigger&quot;&quot; operations. As a consequence, all updates should be done by means of the Adempeire persistence engine, as there are no &quot;&quot;real&quot;&quot; database triggers.</p><p>SQL routines that still exist, such as procedures are generated by source i.e. /adempiere/trunk/db/database/Procedures which create themselves as stored procedures in the database.&quot;</p><ul><li>What is an example of a where clause in an sql statement in Adempiere?</li></ul><p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Where AD_Client_ID=?&quot;&quot; and putting Env.getAD_Client_ID(ctx) for the ?.&quot;</p><ul><li>What is important in understanding tracing SQL Procedures?</li></ul><p>To know what SQL independent codes to debug, you first trace from the AD. Login as Ssytem, look for them within the Table &amp; Column, to first trace which AD Report &amp; Process it is refering to. Then go to that AD Report &amp; Process to find it. SQL are easily identified as ending in *.sql. Now you know which business application process is tied to which SQL. Make sure you get the right one before debugging. You do not need to compile source yet, to test the codes, on your database. You confirm the perfection of your codes in Toad itself. When you are ready to compile, save the procedure or replace the ones in.. adempiere\\trunk\\db\\database\\Procedures.</p><h2 id="callout" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#callout" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Callout</h2><ul><li><p>How may you look at a callout? A callout can be looked at as an extension at the field level.</p></li><li><p>What is important to understand about modifying a Callout in Adempiere? Adempiere tries to absorb user changes by its model of Application Dictionary. However whenever the AD is insufficient to do that, the next promising option is modifying or createing new callouts.</p></li><li><p>What is important to understand in searching for a particular Callout?</p></li></ul><p>Callouts are attached in context to fields of any table defined in Adempiere&#39;s AD Table &amp; Column. Under the Column Tab you will find the Callout field which will call the Callout class whenver the field undergoes input activity. Callout can change the values of other fields in the same Window in scope or in use at that time. Callout can also be used to do data processing but may be clumsy if that overlaps with the proper Java components. Then the app design is looked at again for more elegant planning of changes.</p><ul><li>What can examples of callouts be viewed?</li></ul><p>Examples of callouts can be viewed via Base resource and expanding org.compiere.model tree.</p><ul><li>What is important to understand about defining the callout?</li></ul><p>The callout implements the CalloutEngine interface and uses the Window context. As its in Java, you can call any imported method to be reused for your purpose. But the main methods inherent in a Callout is the getValue and setValue methods which correspond to the field in context. You can think of th eCallout as trying to give you something of an excel spreadsheet.</p><ul><li>What is important to know about opening a callout?</li></ul><p>When you open the right Callout java class, usually its CalloutSystem.java for creating new small snippets. Bigger snippets may have to be in its own class for tidiness.</p><ul><li>What does a callout allow us to do?</li></ul><p>The Callout allows us to take the values of fields of any window in context to be manipulated before putting them back to the fields.</p><ul><li>What is important to understand about creating a form as opposed to implementing the same functionality via dictionary windows, buttons+processes, and/or callouts?</li></ul><p>&quot;A form uses all custom code. Another problem with using forms is that they do not readily translate to the adempiere web client. In Adempiere forms are panels where you need to write all the code to show and manage visual components and database interactions. Forms have an inherent problem because they&#39;re written swing mixing all code (mostly not following MVC model) - they are hard to migrate to web UI client.&quot;</p><h2 id="debugging" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#debugging" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Debugging</h2><ul><li>What cannot be debugged in eclipse?</li></ul><p>Certain codes for Web Store and CServer.jar cannot be debugged in Eclilpse. JBoss is integreated into Adempiere to give it the enterprise heavy duty servicing of web clients and multiple client access to the Adempiere server. CServer codes are also inclusive of the accounts posting and commitment, thus is critical to be resolved by JBoss for more transactional and secured performance. You can still amend Web and accounts code, just that you can&#39;t test them in Eclipse and have to compile them and run as binary to do that.</p><ul><li>What is interesting in understanding identifying a problem in Adempiere?</li></ul><p>To understand if its a business rule or logic that you have mishandled is not easy as you&#39;ll need Adempiere subject matter knowledge.

Set the log4j level etc...</p><ul><li>What does integrating new procedures into Compiere involve?</li></ul><p>To integrate new procedures into Compiere will involve creating the necessary Report &amp; Process in the AD, and calling that from the Table &amp; Column part. You can refer to Compiere&#39;s own present examples to see how its done.</p><p>In understanding the source code of Adempiere, where would one look to debug code dealing with the GUI or interface? org.compiere.grid packages.

This is done after any new changes tables &amp; column in the AD. The rules that you define in the AD will be incorporated during running of GenerateModel, which has a main method to run on its own. After that you can examine the generated codes which are X_*.java. They are located in org.compiere.model of the dbPort base in Eclipse. You cannot amend the codes direactly as they will be overwritten whenever you regenerate. Try to change your business rules in the AD instead.</p><ul><li>What was necessary to run GenerateModel?</li></ul><p>&quot;echo $CLASSPATH /work/adempiere/trunk/adempiere/Adempiere/jboss/server/adempiere/deploy/adempiere.ear/Adempiere.jar:/usr/local/bin/jdk1.5.0_11/jre/lib/javaws.jar:/work/adempiere/trunk/_Project-ID-AdempiereJasper/lib/log4j.jar:/work/adempiere/trunk//adempiere/Adempiere/jboss/server/adempiere/lib/jboss-j2ee.jar:/work/adempiere/trunk/adempiere/Adempiere/jboss/server/adempiere/deploy/adempiere.ear/AdempiereSLib.jar java org.compiere.util.GenerateModel /work/adempiere/trunk/extend/src/org/compiere/model/</p><p>Should see: 13:14:55.179 GenerateModel.writeToFile: /work/adempiere/trunk/extend/src/org/compiere/model/X_XX_Material2.java - 4.5117188 kB 13:14:55.180 GenerateModel.main: Generated = 1</p><p>Remember to set table to Maintained User or this won&#39;t work.&quot;</p><ul><li>What is important about understanding where the logic is really sst in Adempiere?</li></ul><p>Definitely not in X_<em>.java.

When an error is detected you have the option of using back the backup set. Before you intend to touch a java class save the contents in another place. Leave a readme.txt note stating why its there.</p><ul><li>What kinds of changes will be placed in the CClient.jar?</li></ul><p>Usually changes to the non web-store and accounts posting codes will be placed in the CClient.jar.</p><ul><li>What is interesting to know about pushing out the CClient.jar to webstart people?</li></ul><p>Placeing the CClient.jar in Adempiere\\lib directory of your targe live production environment will cause the LAN clients using webstart to automatically refresh themselves when they login as a check will be done to compare with their caches, and will reload again the jars.</p><ul><li>What is important to understand about deploying the CServer.jar?</li></ul><p>Changes to the accounts posting will impact the CServer. Deploying this is more hassle that CClient.jar. Basically is like redoing it as a full setup. You thus have to delete the old Adempiere directory and its subfolders.
