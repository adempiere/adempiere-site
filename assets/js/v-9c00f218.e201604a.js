I have a few questions</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>which basically focus on the value of the source codes</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>offered itself.</p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>When u say evolve from Compiere, do u mean to fork</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><p>of the Compiere project and do we stop and not refer</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>to it?</p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><p>These depends on us but , Yes , the first plan is to make a fork that covers all the needs of the community, which arent of ComPiere &#39;s interest, in the presentation i tried to show these needs.</p><blockquote><ol start="2"><li>Whose base codes shall we use or be refering to? If</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><p>its from Compiere, then how do we arrange the</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>licensing? Wont there be political implications in the</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>market? i.e. people will know.</p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><p>I think that we can have two strategies:</p><p>In the First place we can refer that it is based on ComPiere, althouth the changes that i am propousing are very ambicious, this includes in bring the good and bad things that ComPiere already has, i.e. The inestability, the lack of support, the good marketing , the great platform, etc</p><p>If the project borns to solve all the issues on compiere and we can achieve this, It is convenient for us to say that this software is based in ComPiere?</p><blockquote><ol start="3"><li>Whats the value adding or fresh valuable codes that</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><p>your side or any other can bring to the table?</p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><p>Ok, e-evolution will includes in the project all our code which is until now Manufacture (BOM,Wokflow &amp; Routing,Manufacturing Order, MRP, CRP, Shop floor) , Human Resources &amp; Payroll, Cash Flow ,PostgreSQL port. y suppose that we can integrate too the fixed Assets project from Rob and the work that another people wants to integrate to the project.</p><p>Aditionaly we will start the changes propoused in the document i sent you.</p><blockquote><ol start="4"><li>I generally analyse any proposal into three areas</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><p>within the project:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>a) Source codes part</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>b) Service to users part</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>c) Community part</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I think they must be treated separately. As they are</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>large different issues and not easily tackled even</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>separately.</p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>About community-wise, why not u introduce this openly</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>and let it evolve naturally?</p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><p>Exactly i thinkthat this has to evolve naturally, but it should have a better impact if the community leaders are involved in the project.</p><p>We will have to start a well defined goal and road map.</p><p>Before we officially start with this project, I want to create a strong community group, my intention is not to have a project like JazzERP or Open Bravo which arent , from my point of view, apporting to much with their fork.</p><blockquote><p>I think what Jorg Janke did was he got already his own</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>set of completed high value codes and he gave it</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>openly to spark it off. I have to think of whether</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>this new proposal will stand to compete with that or</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>whats different with it?</p></blockquote><p>Exactly Jorg has a high value code, the reason to use ComPiere is to take a good phrase that a migted sitted over a giant shoulders can see farest than the giant.</p><p>In summary what i am propousing in the document are very specific improvements, all this issues were very recurrents among the users and my customers that are working with compiere right now, ComPiere doesnt have this kind of feedback because they doesnt provide first level support.</p><p>Antoher crucial difference is to mantain a 100% open source project, having knowledge that ComPiere is going to change their business model , and there will be several versions, Compiere GPL, Compiere Light and Compiere Enterprise.</p><p>Regards Victor Perez CEO e-Evolution,S.C. &lt;www.e-evolution.com&gt; skype: vpj-cd</p><blockquote><p>No doubt that Compiere has its weaknesses in the other</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>2 parts as everyone including u state so, but the</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>anchor is still the codes. The rest seems to be</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>downstream effort which i have been doing successfully</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>in my own way, and others also harped in to fill in</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>the gaps. Anyway I am most willing to explore new</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>grounds and apply it again to other project if that</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>first part of codes is of high value.</p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>Best Regards</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>red1</p></blockquote><h2 id="forking-debate-venue-identified" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#forking-debate-venue-identified" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Forking Debate Venue Identified</h2><ul><li>Thu, 31 Aug 2006 14:59:03 -0300</li><li>Email sent to Victor Perez Juarez&quot; <code>victor dot perez at e-evolution dot com</code>, &quot;redhuan daniel oon&quot; <code>redhuanoon at yahoo dot com</code>, &quot;Trifon Trifonov&quot; <code>trifonnt at yahoo dot com</code>, miguel dot jimenez at e-evolution dot com dot mx, mquezada at bodevidrio dot com, ramiro dot vergara at ofbconsulting dot com, mar9000 at gmail dot com, lombardo at mayking dot com, red1 at red1 dot org, robeklein at gmail dot com, zpshen at gmail dot com, fernando dot jimenez at e-evolution dot com dot mx, oscar dot gomez at e-evolution dot com dot mx, lancona at 4layer dot it</li></ul><div class="hint-container info"><p class="hint-container-title">Message</p><p>Hi all,</p><p>I agree with what proposed Carlos.

Or at least Compiere is going to have a version &quot;only for partners&quot;, which is going to leave the &quot;non-partners&quot; in a bad position to give support, make enhancements, etc.</p><p>I believe that we&#39;re going to confront a situation of &quot;partner, fork or go to another project&quot; in a term of months. Maybe we can discuss the fork possibility, or the &quot;go to another project&quot; like OpenBravo, or the possibility to conform a community that talk to Compiere Inc. about we&#39;re thinking (not as individuals, but as community).</p><p>What do you think?
