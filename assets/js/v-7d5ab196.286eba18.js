See <a href="a">Installing ADempiere Manually</a>. This will ensure the setup parameters work and that the database seed is loaded properly. Most importantly, it will create a number of files that will be useful when you want to launch an instance of ADempiere from Eclipse. From the ADempiere home directory where the software was installed, these files are:</p><ul><li>adempiereEnv.properties - copied from adempiereEnvTemplate.properties, this file defines the environment used to setup ADempiere.</li><li>adempiere.properties - this file is generated by the setup process and shouldn&#39;t be edited.

If you can&#39;t see them in the Eclipse &quot;Debug Configurations&quot; or &quot;Run Configurations&quot;, its likely that your project is setup slightly differently than the way the configuration was generated. Check the &quot;Filter launch configurations...&quot; dialog and deselect &quot;Filter Deleted/Unavailable Projects&quot;. All the shared configurations should then appear in the list. To use one of these, copy it and modify it to fit with your setup. Be sure to make this a local copy in the &quot;Common&quot; tab. This will prevent your work from being over writen. A common difference would be in the project name or if the repository is setup as a single project or multiple projects. Some of the configurations use variables such as ${adempierePropertiesFile} which will need to be set before the configuration can be run.</p></div><h4 id="create-debug-and-run-configurations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#create-debug-and-run-configurations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Create Debug and Run Configurations</h4><p>Debug and Run configurations make it easy to launch ADempiere. The configurations can be created under the Eclipse &quot;Run&quot; menu or on the Debug/Run icon pull downs.</p><p>The configurations need the following settings:</p><p>Create a new Java Application configuration. Name: Call it something specific in the case that you have multiple projects Main Tab - Project: browse to your ADempiere project Main Tab - Main class: org.compiere.Adempiere Arguments Tab - VM Arguments: -Xms64m -Xmx64m -Dorg.adempiere.server.embedded=true -DPropertyFile=&quot;C:\\Adempiere\\Adempiere.properties&quot; Common Tab - Select Debug and Run in the &quot;Display in favorites menu&quot;</p><div class="hint-container info"><p class="hint-container-title">Note</p><p>Replace the path to the Adempiere.properties files with the one you wish to use. You can also change the VM Arguments to increase or decrease the amount of memory. The VM arguments define the minimum and maximum RAM allocation for the Java VM. Check the Java documentation for more information.</p></div><p>Create additional configurations for other projects as required.</p><h2 id="create-external-tool-configurations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#create-external-tool-configurations" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Create External Tool Configurations</h2><p>To assist with building ADempiere and other utility functions, you can create external tool configurations that will run the Ant build targets to perform various functions. External tool configurations can be created from the Run-&gt;External Tools-&gt;External Tools Configurations... menu. Each configuration needs the following settings:</p><ul><li>Select &quot;Ant Build&quot; and create a new launch configuration. Give the new configuration a good name like &quot;ADempiere - build&quot;.</li><li>Main Tab - BuildFile: ${workspace_loc:/adempiereTrunk/utils_dev/build.xml} - or wherever the utils_dev/build.xml is located.</li><li>Build Tab - Select &quot;Build before launch.&quot;</li><li>Targets Tab - Select one or more targets. For the basic build, select the default, &quot;complete&quot;.</li><li>Common Tab - Save as local file and select Display in favorites menu - External Tools.</li></ul><p>Create additional configurations as required. A helpful one uses the build target &quot;install&quot; which will partially delete the install location and then install the ADempiere software. The &quot;Clean&quot; target will clean the class directories and &quot;clean all&quot; will perform a clean and delete the install location. Review the code utils_dev/build.xml for more details.</p><p>There are many build files in the project that perform specific tasks. You can also create external tool configurations for these. One helpful one is in the migration directory to install migrations. For example, in the directory adempiereTrunk/migration/380lts-release/postgresql, the build.xml file can apply the long list of migration scripts from within Eclipse. You will need to copy the adempiereTrunk/migration/postgresql.properties.template file to postgresql.properties and modify it for your installation. Then create an External Tool Configuration to run the target &quot;run-scripts&quot;.</p><p>You can also create external tool configurations for some of the basic shell scripts in ADempiere. These are created under the external tool &quot;Program&quot; category. Assuming you have installed adempiere on the C:\\ drive, the suggested targets are:</p><ul><li>c:\\adempiere\\Run_Setup.bat/sh</li><li>c:\\adempiere\\Run_SilentSetup.bat/sh</li><li>c:\\adempiere\\utils\\Run_ImportAdempiere.bat/sh</li></ul><h3 id="compiling-adempiere" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compiling-adempiere" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Compiling ADempiere</h3><p>ADempiere is configured to use two directories for each project: a src directory and a build directory. They have the same structure within each project, differing only on the file suffixes: .class for the build directory and .java for the src directory. Compiling is the process of generating the .class files from of the .java files.</p><p>There are two ways for compiling:</p><ul><li>Automatically: by default, Eclipse builds (i.e. compiles) automatically when changes occur. Project &gt; Build is checked by default after Eclipse installation.</li><li>Manually: in desirable cases you may want to decide when to compile (for example, when debugging the ZK software). Ensure Project &gt; Build Automatically is not checked. You have to remember to manually compile with Eclipse before running ADempiere.</li></ul><h2 id="building-adempiere" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#building-adempiere" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Building ADempiere</h2><p>Building is the process of archiving the class files into jar files and creating the installation files. Do not get confused with usage of the term &quot;build&quot;. For Eclipse it means compiling the java files, whereas for ADempiere it is building the jar files.</p><p>There are three ways for building:</p><ul><li>Via console: open a console, change directory to /adempiere_trunk/utils_dev and run RUN_build.sh. This script performs a clean before building. You see the messages on the console.</li><li>Via Eclipse ANT: in the navigator view, expand utils_dev and select the file build.xml. Run it via context menu (Run as &gt; ANT Build). It is faster because it performs a build without clean.</li><li>Via the external tool configurations created above to run the ANT build.</li></ul><p>Build.xml draws information from the files build.properties and properties.xml. You can also create a file mybuild.properties to override these as required.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t installed a copy of the ADempiere client, you can do so with the ANT build as follows:</p><ul><li>Copy the utils_dev/build.properties file to utils_dev/mybuild.properties or to ${user.home}/.adempiere.properties. Edit the file and change the lines according to where the installed copy of Adempiere should go. For example, to install a copy in c:\\adempiere, use these lines:</li></ul><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>env.ADEMPIERE_ROOT=c:/\nenv.ADEMPIERE_HOME=${env.ADEMPIERE_ROOT}/Adempiere\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><ul><li>Create an external tool configuration to run the ANT target utils_dev/build.xml-&gt;install.</li><li>Build ADempiere, if you haven&#39;t already (use your external tool or select utils_dev/build.xml and run as ANT build).</li><li>Install ADempiere - using the external tool config created above.</li><li>Create external tool configurations to execute programs c:\\adempiere\\run_setup and c:\\adempiere\\run_silentsetup as described above. Execute run_setup the first time and then run_silentsetup if you need to in the future. Set the parameters according to the instructions in <a href="a">Application Server Installation &amp; Setup</a>.
