I think Metas contributions are worth the effort.\n[06:28:32] Cristina Ghita: Yes, monday Tobi will come from vacation and we will make a plan and try boost up the metas contriubtions\n[06:30:59] Cristina Ghita: ok\n[06:31:08] Cristina Ghita: Next item then?\n[06:31:26] Cristina Ghita: Suman you&#39;re done?\n[06:32:14] suman ravuri: yes\n[06:32:20] Cristina Ghita: ok\n[06:32:24] Cristina Ghita: * Technical team reviews\n[06:32:49] Victor Perez Juarez: We will make indestructible changues ?\n[06:33:11] Cristina Ghita: I did not finshed reviewing Info forms.. so not much from my side\n[06:34:05] Mario Calderón: @Victor: what are &quot;indestructible changues&quot;?\n[06:34:17] Victor Perez Juarez: I need make of revision of manufacturing ligh\n[06:35:06] Victor Perez Juarez: Infrestructure changues\n[06:35:50] suman ravuri: I kept Manufacturing lite on hold\n[06:35:53] Mario Calderón: understand: infrastructure changes.

This must IMHO be discussed and tested thoroughly.\n\nThough I agree on the matter.\n[06:39:06] suman ravuri: [6:06:38 PM] suman ravuri: I kept Manufacturing lite on hold\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; Kindly let me know If I need to continue with Integration and what changes I need to make on manufacuring lite\n[06:39:17] Victor Perez Juarez: Suman we need of way to replace a enterprice Java beans and we would deployment tomcat 7 to remove jboss\n[06:39:33] suman ravuri: Yes Mario.

point\n[06:54:45] suman ravuri: I can make request\n[06:54:52] Cristina Ghita: ok, will be great\n[06:55:25] Cristina Ghita: Next point\n\n* Actions to be taken\n[06:56:46] Mario Calderón: - Metas will come up with a plan to enable reviewing its contributions.\n\n\n\n- All other contributors will complete its instances and branches the same way...\n[06:57:10] Cristina Ghita: ok\n[06:57:23] Cristina Ghita: Now misc\n[06:57:50] Cristina Ghita: * making available an example in DB for HR&amp;Payroll\n[06:58:45] Mario Calderón: Steven raised the point last week...\n\nI think we should bring it to the roadmap Wiki page, don&#39;t you think so?\n[06:58:59] Cristina Ghita: yes\n[06:59:06] Mario Calderón: so we can put items like HR, new periods, etc....\n[06:59:10] Mario Calderón: I can do it\n[06:59:27] Cristina Ghita: ah.. and also at Actions to be take: Creat a poll for posterita code\n[06:59:38] Mario Calderón: OK..\n[07:00:10] Victor Perez Juarez: And HTML old\n[07:00:15] Cristina Ghita: yes\n[07:00:27] Cristina Ghita: who will create?\n[07:00:31] Cristina Ghita: Suman?\n[07:00:32] Cristina Ghita: or?\n[07:00:38] Mario Calderón: so three things:\n\n- JBoss/Tomcat, Posterita, HTML , etc\n\n- updating GW database\n\n- (what else?)\n[07:00:55] Mario Calderón: I will update the wiki page\n[07:01:05] Victor Perez Juarez: So if we add mobile ui should remove HTML old\n[07:02:05] Mario Calderón: I will write it and you all can improve it\n[07:02:27] Cristina Ghita: ok\n[07:02:41] Cristina Ghita: what about  Release date?\n[07:02:53] Mario Calderón: About release date: perhaps can Suman tell us how long he still needs to finish integrating.\n\nThen we can wait for Metas to come up with a plan for reviewing.\n\nAlso for WT&#39;s contributions.\n\nSo I think we can set a date for Suman and wait for Metas and WT.\n[07:03:22] Victor Perez Juarez: I received repuest from cruck to contribute with example of libero mfg but he want wait to have rc\n[07:03:39] Cristina Ghita: ok, hopefully next week, we (metas) will have a plan\n[07:03:52] Mario Calderón: @Victor: who is &quot;cruck&quot; ?\n[07:04:19] Mario Calderón: but I think, suman can tell us something about what&#39;s is existent now\n[07:04:40] Victor Perez Juarez: Is other usa implementor\n[07:04:49] suman ravuri: All the issues that are ready for integration and technically

Calderón: so, mainly WT&#39;s and Metas&#39; contribs are missing, but again this is because there are no code nor instance to review\n[07:09:23] suman ravuri: MRP Supply and Demand Pegging  \n\nMRP Browse for demand and supply   \n\nNet Change Material Plan and Selective Material Plant  \n\nSmart Browse for approval of Planning Order\n[07:09:31] Mario Calderón: so it is on them to provide ways
