 ;-)\n[07:33:23] Victor Perez Juarez: then I not sure how you separate of cost from parent of components\n[07:33:55] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): in ML we have only one cost there is no LL\n[07:33:57] Victor Perez Juarez: I suppose have not use labor and burden\n[07:34:14] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): have but in a different way\n[07:36:26] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): we have one or many service products and these are in place of your processes ... but each service product could be a BOM and have as few or as many items of cost making it up as you want.. so you might have &quot;brake press operation&quot; and it could be a BOM of labour, supervision, consumable, electricity,rent, planned maintenance, breakdown maintenance etc.\n[07:37:37] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): so when you know how many hours of &#39;brake press operation&#39; happened in the month you can explode out to all the standard cost allowances in as much details as you want\n[07:37:53] Victor Perez Juarez: do you management the concept of frozen cost , is a good practice in standard cost\n[07:39:10] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Manuf Light is for people migrating fom an accounting system and a bunch of spreadsheets .. I dont think they will worry too much about some of the good practice things ... just want easy to use.\n[07:39:37] Victor Perez Juarez: JJ used the future cost to create a standard cost projected and the idea is copy this cost to standard cost she is ready , for this we need an frozen and unfrozen cost\n[07:40:00] Victor Perez Juarez: if this functionality we can revaluate the standard cost by error\n[07:40:07] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): anyway pls review and suggest anything you think improves the fit in ADempiere\n[07:40:22] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): its 23:40 here so I will say goodnight to all\n[07:40:26] Victor Perez Juarez: ok\n[07:40:40] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): goodnight all,\n[07:40:54] Victor Perez Juarez: yes the idea is that libero and Manuf Light work harmoniously\n[07:41:05] suman ravuri: +1 for Victor\n[07:41:08] Victor Perez Juarez: and if some customer need migrate some more complex\n[07:41:16] Victor Perez Juarez: it can be transparent\n[07:41:25] suman ravuri: Let us find ways\n[07:41:37] Victor Perez Juarez: yes Suman we need work in this\n[07:41:50] suman ravuri: yes\n[07:42:02] suman ravuri: Let us this offline together\n[07:42:05] suman ravuri: take\n[07:42:06] Victor Perez Juarez: So I think that first step is set the Adaxa code into new brnch\n[07:42:22] Victor Perez Juarez: branch based on of last 380rc1\n[07:42:29] suman ravuri: ok\n[07:42:42] Victor Perez Juarez: so we can work in this\n[07:42:47] suman ravuri: ok\n[07:42:57] Victor Perez Juarez: please help me testing\n[07:43:06] suman ravuri: I will have that branch ready\n[07:43:10] Victor Perez Juarez: if all is ok with repository and sub repository\n[07:43:17] Victor Perez Juarez: if not then I need fix\n[07:43:45] Victor Perez Juarez: I can not know if other had issue because I am work without issues\n[07:48:27] suman ravuri: ok\n[07:48:40] suman ravuri: Will ping you to your id\n[07:48:50] suman ravuri: bye Victor\n[08:01:31] Victor Perez Juarez:
