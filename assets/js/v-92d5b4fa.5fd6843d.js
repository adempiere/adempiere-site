If the role does not have access to the Processes, then access to Activities is checked and the <code>{{#if: Workflow Activities|Workflow Activities|WorkflowActivities }} Form</code> is opened. If this test also fails, the <code>{{#if: Workflow Activities|Workflow Activities|WorkflowActivities }}</code> Form will open as a default but may be read only.</p><h2 id="workflow-process" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#workflow-process" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Workflow Process</h2><p>The <code>{{#if: Workflow Process|Workflow Process|WorkflowProcess }} Window</code> appears as shown below, possibly displaying data about the workflow associated with the current record. If there is none, the window may appear ready to enter a new record.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/community/developers-guide/ManPageW_WorkflowProcess_Process.png" alt="ManPage"></p><p>The <code>{{#if: Workflow Process|Workflow Process|WorkflowProcess }} Window</code> has three tabs showing the overall process, activities in the process and events related to the activities. See the <code>{{#if: Workflow Process|Workflow Process|WorkflowProcess }} Window</code> ManPage for more information.</p><p>If a workflow is displayed in the window, you can manage the workflow process in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Cancel the workflow process</li><li>Assign a different user to be responsible for performing the work</li><li>Assign a different organization</li></ul><p>Clicking on the <strong>Manage Process</strong> button will allow you to do so. The button will open a simple dialog where you can make the changes.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/community/developers-guide/WorkflowManageProcessDialog.png" alt="WorkflowManage"></p><p>If you assign a new person responsible, the workflow activity will appear in their main panel tab labeled Workflow Activities when the workflow processor next runs.</p><h3 id="workflow-activities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#workflow-activities" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Workflow Activities</h3><p>The Workflow Activities can be found in the main panel in the horizontal tabs. The tab will show the number of workflow processes you have been assigned.</p><p><img src="/assets/img/community/developers-guide/WorkflowActivities.png" alt="workflowActivities"></p><p>At the top of the form is a list of the active workflows that are awaiting your attention. Selecting one of them will fill the rest of the form with information about the workflow. The image shows a business partner approval process. GardenUser has created a new business partner and GardenAdmin has to approve it. The &quot;approval&quot; is performed by clicking the Confirm button. In addition to the approval, there is an &quot;Answer&quot; action, in this instance a button labeled &quot;Business Partner&quot; which will open the relevant business partner record to allow a review of the new business partner.</p><p>The answer actions and approval/completion processes can be quite varied, complex and tailored to the specific workflow process being followed. However, in general, each step (called a &quot;node&quot;) in the process requires the user to provide an answer/perform an action before the process can move on to the next step.</p><p>The Workflow Activies form displays the name of the node, a description, some help text and a list of history records.</p><p>Below the history records is a Answer/Action control which changes form depending on the intended answer/action. The types of answers/actions can be:</p><ul><li>Wait (sleep) for a period of time or until a condition is met</li><li>User Choice (typically Yes or No for documents that require approval)</li><li>Start a sub-workflow</li><li>Set a variable</li><li>Open a window (as in the example above)</li><li>Open a form</li><li>Perform some application task</li><li>Open a report</li><li>Start an application process</li><li>Perform a Document Action - (Complete, Close)</li><li>Send an email</li></ul><p>Some of these options will be automatic in the workflow design. The options presented to a user will be in the form of a combo box list, a text field or a button. The buttons will open a window or form.</p><p>On the right of the form is a zoom icon (<img src="/assets/img/community/developers-guide/Icon_Zoom24.png" alt="IconZoom">) which will take you to the source record.</p><p>Below the Answer actions and Zoom icon, there is also a &quot;Messages&quot; box. Anything entered in this field will be added to the history records.</p><p>If the workflow node needs to be sent to another user&#39;s attention, they can be selected in the &quot;Forward&quot; box. (You can&#39;t forward the Activity to yourself.)</p><p>Finally, the Confirm button, when clicked, will complete and execute the action.</p><h2 id="see-also" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#see-also" aria-hidden="true">#</a> See also</h2><ul><li><a href="a">Workflows Explained</a></li><li><a href="a">How to Activate Document Approval Workflow</a></li><li><a href="a">How to Configure Dynamic Approval Workflow</a></li><li><a href="a">Workflow-TestSample</a></li></ul><h2 id="for-developers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#for-developers" aria-hidden="true">#</a> For Developers</h2><p>The software that controls this dialog is found in</p><ul><li><p>base/src</p><ul><li>org.compiere.model.X_AD_WF_Node.java</li><li>org.compiere.wf.MWFActivity.java</li></ul></li><li><p>client/src</p><ul><li>org.compiere.apps.wf.WFActivity.java</li></ul></li></ul>',39)],r={},a=(0,t(42272).c)(r,[["render",function(e,o){return(0,i.Wz)(),(0,i.An)("div",null,s)}]])},77780:(e,o,t)=>{t.r(o),t.d(o,{data:()=>i});const i=JSON.parse('{"key":"v-92d5b4fa","path":"/community/wiki/developers-guide/workflow.html","title":"Workflow","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Workflow","category":"Community","star":9,"sticky":9,"tag":["Wiki","Developer\'s Guide"],"article":false,"description":"The Workflow system automates the movement and approval processes in a business.
