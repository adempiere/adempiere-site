HG fails in the update with an invalid file error or a note that the org.eevolution.manufacturing director exists and is not empty.\n[06:47:17] Mario Calderón: can somebody document this so others can avoid these problems?\n[06:48:01] Victor Perez Juarez: @Mike , yes because try synchronize with git\n[06:48:06] Cristina Ghita: or Victor, just do it public with read only\n[06:48:24] Victor Perez Juarez: if you delete of directory then will try make a pull\n[06:48:33] Victor Perez Juarez: and this solve of issue\n[06:49:06] Victor Perez Juarez: in  your case not should had some issue because have github user\n[06:49:22] Victor Perez Juarez: ok I need testing this\n[06:49:40] Victor Perez Juarez: let review and check with Mario we had pending this task\n[06:50:23] Michael McKay: When I do the hg pull, nothing gets updated. What should I see when I do this?\n[06:50:43] Victor Perez Juarez: the dilemma of all this is to try to keep the story of commints\n[06:51:31] suman ravuri: @Victor, my suggestion would be not to have history in case it creating issues with repository\n[06:51:35] Victor Perez Juarez: she you make pull , in tis moment detect that exist an sub repository\n[06:52:03] Victor Perez Juarez: mercurial let management sub repository in any other technology in this case git\n[06:52:16] suman ravuri: I would like to have history but not at cost of repository stability\n[06:52:28] Victor Perez Juarez: then when detect the git sub repository try pull of sub repository\n[06:55:58] Victor Perez Juarez: is actually sub repositories using git or mercurial, but I see that this is complicating the management and many want nothing to do with git, so I think it&#39;s best to disable subrepositorios\n[06:55:59] Michael McKay: That is my problem.  The hg update that works doesn&#39;t have the sub repo.  I can see the sub repo in the pulled branches but I can&#39;t update to those branches.  I think I need an intermediate step - a commit that deletes the org.eevolution.manufacturing directory completely followed by a commit that adds the sub repo.\n[06:56:43] Victor Perez Juarez: I am using http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ and it have not issue with subrepository\n[06:57:01] Victor Perez Juarez: but can understand that not all can install this software\n[06:57:04] suman ravuri: but it not working even in windows\n[06:57:58] Mario Calderón: a question: what if we postpone this subrepository thing and leave it as it was???\n[06:58:16] Mario Calderón: I think it is NOT a must right now\n[06:58:35] Mario Calderón: perhaps in the future, but it creates lots of problems\n[06:58:40] Victor Perez Juarez: the problem is that we had conflict because the new class is commit in mercurial news files , but same time are as sub repository\n[06:58:48] Schöneberg, Tobias (metas.de): the problem why you use the subrepo, instead of extenal repo is that libero needs adempiere-base, and the adempiere build-all-process needs libero..so it&#39;s a cyclic dependency between adempiere and libero, right?\n[06:59:09] Mario Calderón: so I suggest to commit as it as it was in the original branch and for the next release we test and try out\n[06:59:15] Mario Calderón: What do you think?\n[06:59:44] Victor Perez Juarez: @Tobi, yes it was a big issue\n[07:00:05] Victor Perez Juarez: the idea of integrate al code is solve this issue and was solve\n[07:00:35] Victor Perez Juarez: but I think that it can solve if I reactive the sub repository feature\n[07:01:28] Cristina Ghita: Ok. So which is the conclusion?\n[07:01:45] Cristina Ghita: How we proceed for this release?\n[07:03:13] Schöneberg, Tobias (metas.de): my suggestion would be to remove the subrepo and just &quot;dump&quot; the current libero code into adempiere...for next release, we split up the adempiere-build process\n[07:03:30] Schöneberg, Tobias (metas.de): into compile (base etc) and assembly\n[07:03:42] Victor Perez Juarez: So I think that more easy is ignore  .hgsub\n[07:04:03] Schöneberg, Tobias (metas.de): then there could be many compile jobs, for base, libero, dunning..and one assembly job\n[07:04:05] Victor Perez Juarez: all the user no need of sub repository functionality\n[07:05:14] Victor Perez Juarez: so that I can ignore of  .hgsub this way I think that other can clone without some issue\n[07:05:41] Cristina Ghita: Pros/Cons ?\n[07:06:21] Victor Perez Juarez: the pros is that any development that want work with payroll and manufacturing need use git\n[07:06:32] Victor Perez Juarez: and commit in this project n in mercuial\n[07:06:39] Schöneberg, Tobias (metas.de): [15:06:02] Victor Perez Juarez:  ignore of  .hgsub \n\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; (sorry when this was already clear) you amean add .hgsub to .hgignore?\n[07:07:18] Victor Perez Juarez: @Tobi , yes it is the idea add .hgsub into  .hgignore\n[07:07:53] Victor Perez Juarez: this way mercurial should ignore the sub repository\n[07:08:27] suman ravuri: does it solve circular dependency?\n[07:08:31] suman ravuri: issue?\n[07:08:51] Victor Perez Juarez: the circular dependency was solve in the last commit\n[07:08:59] Victor Perez Juarez: for payroll and manufacturing\n[07:09:36] Schöneberg, Tobias (metas.de): [15:08:05] Victor Perez Juarez: @Tobi , yes it is the idea add .hgsub into  .hgignore\n\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; hm..would be ok for me as an ad-hoc solution..i still think the other solution i proposed is better, but i guess i&#39;m free to create a jira issue and implement it for next release ;-)\n[07:09:42] Victor Perez Juarez: now all project compile without issue\n[07:10:50] Victor Perez Juarez: @Tobi the problem is that the changes was propagate\n[07:11:00] Victor Perez Juarez: to central repository\n[07:11:18] Victor Perez Juarez: try now rollback all tho change is more work that solve the issue\n[07:14:24] Mario Calderón: are we finished with this problem?\n[07:14:26] Victor Perez Juarez: also with the last commit is compiling correctly every project with the integration of manufacturing and payroll,  all scripts were consolidated into a single directory and the view were synchronized with the db directory\n[07:14:49] Cristina Ghita: Ok\n[07:15:13] Cristina Ghita: Then, Victor, pls add hgsub to ignore\n[07:15:13] Schöneberg, Tobias (metas.de): ah, maybe one more thing\n\n@suman: can you still build the whole thing with the libero subrepo?\n[07:15:38] Schöneberg, Tobias (metas.de): because on adsd1 (without git-support) it currently doesn&#39;t work\n[07:15:53] suman ravuri: I was able to launch with in eclipse\n[07:16:20] Victor Perez Juarez: @Suman , yes with eclipse no is issue\n[07:16:29] suman ravuri: I did not try building a ear recently\n[07:16:48] Victor Perez Juarez: but the last comping you can not execute a complete dev_utils/build.xml\n[07:17:27] Victor Perez Juarez: it is a gold rule, the project always should compile\n[07:18:08] Cristina Ghita: Then if it works the build, go with Victor&#39;s version, if not, go with Tobi&#39;s version. WDYT?\n[07:18:32] Victor Perez Juarez: she some people modify any view , also should modify the source view for oracle and postgresql\n[07:19:05] Victor Perez Juarez: I saw for example that the Mike contribution , he modify some views\n[07:19:18] Victor Perez Juarez: but it not was synchronize with db/ddutils\n[07:20:22] Victor Perez Juarez: I use some hours to synchronize the views that are into of sql script to update also of db/ddlutils\n[07:21:19] suman ravuri: @Victor, RM will do that or contributor will do this work generally?\n[07:21:37] suman ravuri: updating db/ddlutils?\n[07:22:09] Victor Perez Juarez: in general is a our best practical\n[07:22:23] Cristina Ghita: Contributor\n[07:22:44] Cristina Ghita: But might escape somwtimes..\n[07:23:43] Victor Perez Juarez: to keep healthy our code when adding a contribution\n[07:24:57] Victor Perez Juarez: @Cris is a rule , if you modify a view also need modify the source of view\n[07:25:24] Cristina Ghita: yes, I know\n[07:25:41] Cristina Ghita: but I said, that sometime myght escape, and the intiial contributor shoudl fix it\n[07:25:46] Victor Perez Juarez: this was always  from compiere, the same applies to any function\n[07:26:08] Victor Perez Juarez: some contributor I think that not know\n[07:26:46] Cristina Ghita: yes, or other; but mainly who contributed should maintein proper hsi work\n[07:26:49] Cristina Ghita: right?\n[07:26:52] Victor Perez Juarez: is part of process of contribute, I Mike know that if need add a view or modify then need change the source\n[07:27:22] Cristina Ghita: anyway, is not the point now\n[07:27:29] Cristina Ghita: I think\n[07:27:30] Mario Calderón: so.... what&#39;s the solution?\n[07:27:32] Victor Perez Juarez: i think should be\n[07:27:55] Victor Perez Juarez: now we are try include all contribution into of 380rc1\n[07:28:04] Victor Perez Juarez: but not should brace our rules\n[07:28:31] Victor Perez Juarez: can change of rule , but of rule that we had now should following\n[07:29:20] Victor Perez Juarez: about of sub repository let me solve this issue I deactivate sub repository this way other not had some issue\n[07:30:09] Victor Perez Juarez: any developer that need work with libero and payroll should use the original repository from github\n[07:30:10] Cristina Ghita: so, then can we go Like this:\n\n[16:18:57] Cristina Ghita: Then if it works the build, go with Victor&#39;s version, if not, go with Tobi&#39;s version. WDYT?\n\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; \n[07:30:23] Mario Calderón: +1\n[07:30:34] Victor Perez Juarez: and the rest of developer that not need change any from this contribution then have not some issue\n[07:30:35] Cristina Ghita: Victor does that, fi all biuld .. remian like that\n[07:30:47] Cristina Ghita: if not, go like Tobi\n[07:30:50] Cristina Ghita: +1\n[07:31:33] Cristina Ghita: and as Victor said, should work\n[07:31:44] Victor Perez Juarez: I would are agree go with the Tob version , then make work to reorganize the sql migration\n[07:31:55] Victor Perez Juarez: and synchronize all view in  source\n[07:32:14] Cristina Ghita: and then will find a better solution in next releases\n[07:33:30] Victor Perez Juarez: other issue that I found Suman , is that you update of adempiere.jar seed half of the release process\n[07:34:25] Victor Perez Juarez: it not is right , so that we should can execute all migration script from last release version\n[07:34:36] suman ravuri: are we taking about seed?\n[07:34:52] suman ravuri: seed I generated fee weeks back\n[07:34:52] Victor Perez Juarez: when I reorganize the all sequence of migration script\n[07:35:11] Victor Perez Juarez: and apply it from zero got a lot of issues\n[07:35:15] suman ravuri: I can generate when we reach next milestone\n[07:35:24] Victor Perez Juarez: I check and can see that the seed was update\n[07:35:48] Victor Perez Juarez: of seed only is genera when of release is ready\n[07:36:05] Victor Perez Juarez: and we all the migration script in single directory\n[07:36:36] suman ravuri: but seed was requested last time\n[07:36:54] Victor Perez Juarez: yes , this reason that exist a migration script\n[07:37:26] suman ravuri: Team asked me to prepate seed asap so I generated with the list of features I have done till that ime\n[07:37:27] suman ravuri: time\n[07:37:39] Victor Perez Juarez: ant script that is use to build night\n[07:38:07] suman ravuri: but ant script will not work with new adaxa migration\n[07:38:35] Victor Perez Juarez: yes it will be for future after the 380\n[07:39:03] Victor Perez Juarez: now we had both sql script and xml\n[07:39:33] Victor Perez Juarez: after of 380 we only should accept xml scripts\n[07:39:43] suman ravuri: agree\n[07:40:13] Victor Perez Juarez: in my last mint you can see that I reorganize all sql scripts\n[07:40:22] Victor Perez Juarez: and synchronize the view with of source\n[07:41:05] Victor Perez Juarez: it is hard work because some contribution modify the same view , so you need are sure that all modification was rightly  merge\n[07:41:35] Victor Perez Juarez: mint = commit\n[07:41:47] suman ravuri: I see your changes\n[07:42:44] Mario Calderón: @all: can you discuss this issue later?\n\nI&#39;d like that we move on
