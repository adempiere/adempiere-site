This code of conduct applies to your behavior in those forums too. Please follow these guidelines in addition to the general code of conduct:</p><ul><li>Please use a valid email address to which direct responses can be made.</li><li>Please avoid flamewars, trolling, personal attacks, repetitive arguments, advertising.</li><li>On technical matters, the PMC can make a final decision.</li><li>On matters of community governance, the CC can make a final decision.</li></ul><h2 id="behavior" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#behavior" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Behavior</h2><p>This code of conduct covers our behavior as members of the ADempiere Community, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, website, Internet relay chat (IRC) channel, install-fest, public meeting or private correspondence. ADempiere governance bodies are ultimately accountable to the ADempiere Community Council and will arbitrate in any dispute over the conduct of a member of the community.</p><ul><li><p>Be considerate. Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should take those consequences into account when making decisions. ADempiere has plenty of users and contributors. Even if it&#39;s not obvious at the time, our contributions to ADempiere will impact the work of others. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy, documentation and translations during a release may negatively impact others&#39; work.</p></li><li><p>Be respectful. The ADempiere community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to ADempiere. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It&#39;s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the ADempiere community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside the ADempiere project and with users of ADempiere.</p></li><li><p>Be collaborative. Collaboration is central to ADempiere and to the larger free software community. We encourage individuals and teams to work together whether inside or outside the ADempiere Project. This collaboration reduces redundancy, and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we should always be open to collaboration. Wherever possible, we should work closely with upstream projects and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts in all areas whether they be technical, advocacy or documentation. Our work should be done transparently and we should involve as many interested parties as early as possible. If we decide to take a different approach than others, we will let them know early, document our work and inform others regularly of our progress.</p></li><li><p>When we disagree, we consult others. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and the ADempiere community is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively and with the help of the community and community processes. We have the Project Management Committee, the Community Council which help to decide the right course for ADempiere.</p></li><li><p>When we are unsure, we ask for help. Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the ADempiere community. Asking questions avoids many problems down the road, and so questions are encouraged. Those who are asked questions should be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, care must be taken to do so in an appropriate forum.</p></li><li><p>Step down considerately. Members of every project come and go and ADempiere is no different. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that they do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.</p></li></ul><p>The ADempiere code of conduct is copied from the ubuntu code of conduct, modified and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 licence.</p>',7),m={},u=(0,i(42272).c)(m,[["render",function(e,t){const i=(0,o.E1)("ExternalLinkIcon"),m=(0,o.E1)("RouterLink");return(0,o.Wz)(),(0,o.An)("div",null,[(0,o.QD)("div",n,[a,(0,o.QD)("p",null,[(0,o.mY)("This concept was accepted by the citizens via vote on 23 of August 2010 "),(0,o.QD)("a",r,[(0,o.mY)("1"),(0,o.K2)(i)])])]),(0,o.QD)("p",null,[(0,o.mY)("Current CC Team can be found here: "),(0,o.K2)(m,{to:"/community/community-council-team/"},{default:(0,o.Ql)((()=>[(0,o.mY)("Community Council Team")])),_:1})]),l,(0,o.QD)("p",null,[(0,o.mY)("Source: "),(0,o.QD)("a",c,[(0,o.mY)("2"),(0,o.K2)(i)])]),s])}]])},84763:(e,t,i)=>{i.r(t),i.d(t,{data:()=>o});const o=JSON.parse('{"key":"v-9f3c4160","path":"/community/community-council-team/community-governance.html","title":"Community Governance","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Community Governance","category":"Community","star":9,"sticky":9,"tag":["Community Details","Community"],"article":false,"description":"Note This concept was accepted by the citizens via vote on 23 of August 2010 1 Current CC Team can be found here: Community Council Team","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere-site.github.io/community/community-council-team/community-governance.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Community Governance"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Note This concept was accepted by the citizens via vote on 23 of August 2010 1 Current CC Team can be found here: Community Council Team"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2023-07-28T19:18:22.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"ADempiere"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"Community Details"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"Community"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2023-07-28T19:18:22.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"WebPage\\",\\"name\\":\\"Community Governance\\",\\"description\\":\\"Note This concept was accepted by the citizens via vote on 23 of August 2010 1 Current CC Team can be found here: Community Council Team\\"}"],["link",{"rel":"alternate","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere-site.github.io/atom.xml","title":" Atom Feed"}],["link",{"rel":"alternate","type":"application/json","href":"https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere-site.github.io/feed.json","title":" JSON Feed"}],["link",{"rel":"alternate","type":"application/rss+xml","href":"https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere-site.github.io/rss.xml","title":" RSS Feed"}]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Community Council","slug":"community-council","link":"#community-council","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Initial Staffing Process","slug":"initial-staffing-process","link":"#initial-staffing-process","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Election of Community Council","slug":"election-of-community-council","link":"#election-of-community-council","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Election of Community Council Head","slug":"election-of-community-council-head","link":"#election-of-community-council-head","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Escalation Procedure","slug":"escalation-procedure","link":"#escalation-procedure","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"CC Team -
