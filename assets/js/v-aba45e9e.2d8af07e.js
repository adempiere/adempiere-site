Be careful not to overwrite the build_custom.xml file in the template. This will provide the same deployment structure as the main ADempiere project. (This step is necessary and could be automated but risks overwriting your customization so it has been left as a manual process.)</p><p>Delete the zkwebui/WEB-INF/src source tree, leaving only the files you wish to customize. The template has only one file LoginPanel.java which changes the login header to &quot;My Customization Works!&quot;.</p><p>Replace the name of MyCustomizationProject with the actual name of your project in the launcher MyCustomizationProject InitializeZKCustomizations which you find in the directory tools/launchers. Run the launcher MyCustomizationProject InitializeZKCustomizations - this will copy all the classes needed from the adempiere project to the template. Depending on the version of ADempiere, you may need to modify the associated build.xml file. Note, if you do this by hand from the build file, don&#39;t forget to refresh the project files.</p><p>If you are customizing zk, add a server and add the template to the server. In the server launcher, the class path for the user entries needs to include the following:</p><ul><li>C:/dev/apache/tomcat-6.0/bin/bootstrap.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/tools/lib/jnlp.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/tools/lib/javaee.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/tools/lib/jcommon-1.0.18.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/tools/lib/jfreechart-1.0.15.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/tools/lib/log4j.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/JasperReportsTools/lib/jasperreports-5.1.0.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/tools/lib/c3p0-0.9.1.2.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/tools/lib/iText-2.1.7.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/tools/lib/poi-3.9-20121203.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/lib/postgresql.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/tools/lib/commons-net-1.4.0.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/tools/lib/commons-collections-3.1.jar</li><li>adempiereTrunk/tools/lib/barbecue-1.5-beta1.jar</li></ul><p>These are the defaults in the launcher included with the project. You will need to point the classes in the launcher at the correct project name for the ADempiere project.</p><h2 id="testing-with-the-template" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#testing-with-the-template" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Testing with the template</h2><p>With that the template should be good to go. You may need to update the build files to adjust to ADempiere versions. If you customize other directories than build and client, also copy the build.xml files from the ADempiere project and modify them to add the customized classes to the jar files. Compare the build.xml from the base directory in both the template and the ADempiere project.</p><p>If you launch the server, you should see the changes in the zk files. If you make any changes, you will have to restart the server to see them.</p><p>The launcher for the client will run the client as per the main project. Here, most changes you make will be hot-swapped into the application which is really nice for development.</p><h2 id="exporting-the-customization-jars" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#exporting-the-customization-jars" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Exporting the Customization Jars</h2><p>When your customization is ready, there is a launcher to build the customization jars. The two files customization.jar and zkcustomization.jar will be added to the lib directory. You can add these to the lib directory of the ADempiere installation and execute the setup (RUN_Setup or RUN_SilentSetup) to see the changes.</p>',18),l={href:"http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Adempiere_Technical_Training#Project_Customization_Management_Hints",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},c=(0,i.QD)("p",null,"Enjoy !",-1),h=(0,i.QD)("h2",{id:"see-also",tabindex:"-1"},[(0,i.QD)("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#see-also","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),(0,i.mY)(" See Also")],-1),m={href:"https://wiki.adempiere.net/ModelValidator",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},u={},p=(0,o(42272).c)(u,[["render",function(e,t){const o=(0,i.E1)("RouterLink"),u=(0,i.E1)("ExternalLinkIcon");return(0,i.Wz)(),(0,i.An)("div",null,[r,(0,i.QD)("ol",null,[(0,i.QD)("li",null,[(0,i.mY)("If you haven't already done so, follow the "),(0,i.K2)(o,{to:"/community/wiki/developers-guide/adempiere-version-control.html"},{default:(0,i.Ql)((()=>[(0,i.mY)("ADempiere Version Control")])),_:1}),(0,i.mY)(" process to checkout a branch of the ADempiere project.")]),(0,i.QD)("li",null,[(0,i.K2)(o,{to:"/community/wiki/developers-guide/create-your-adempiere-development-environment.html"},{default:(0,i.Ql)((()=>[(0,i.mY)("Create your ADempiere development environment")])),_:1}),(0,i.mY)(" and, if you are modifying the zk interface, "),(0,i.K2)(o,{to:"/community/wiki/developers-guide/creating-webui-workspace-using-eclipse-webtool.html"},{default:(0,i.Ql)((()=>[(0,i.mY)("Creating WebUI Workspace using Eclipse Webtool")])),_:1})]),a,n,(0,i.QD)("li",null,[(0,i.mY)("You now have the main ADempiere project created.
