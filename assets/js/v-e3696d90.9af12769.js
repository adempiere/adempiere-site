The project adempiere/migration folder will contain a number of folders of the form <code>&lt;old&gt;-&lt;new&gt;</code> with sub- folders for each database and for the XML files. The build process will copy any directory that includes the release string - for example /370lts-380lts/* and /380lts-release/* - as long as the directory and sub- folders contain sql or xml files. The build/install process will copy these directories to $ADEMPIERE_HOME/migration/*.</li><li>Compile a build of the software at the release version.</li><li>Install the software and RUN_Setup to configure it for the target database</li><li>From the previous release, copy the seed file - either Adempiere.jar or Adempiere_pg.jar to the $ADEMPIERE_HOME/data directory - overwrite the ones installed.</li><li>Import the previous seed into the database with RUN_ImportAdempiere.[sh|bat] - this will put the database in the state of the previous release. Don&#39;t use the current seed if its been updated during development. Rather, return to a known release state and migrate from there. This is similar to what users will experience in the field so its best to make sure it works.</li><li>Apply any SQL as indicated below. Following 380 there shouldn&#39;t be any SQL, but if features with SQL were added to the release, there may be some to apply. Check the $AEMPIERE_HOME/migration folder for sub-folders related to the databases.</li><li>Import the xml migration files as follows: <ol><li>From the command line, execute the batch file RUN_MigrateXML.[sh|bat]. This will import all XML files that were installed in the $ADEMPIERE_HOME/migration directory by the build &amp; install process. The command can be run multiple times without harm.</li><li>From the client, if it can run with the past seed, you can also log in as the System Administrator and use the process &quot;Import Migrations from XML&quot;. Point the File Name dialog at the $AEMPIERE_HOME/migration folder and select the &quot;Apply&quot; check box. You can run the process without selecting apply, but there may be errors if newer migration files depend on the application of older ones. You can run the process multiple times without harm.</li></ol></li><li>Verify the logs show no error messages. If necessary, fix errors in the XML or code and repeat the import and migrate process until there are no errors.</li><li>Export the new seed database using RUN_DBExport.[sh|bat]</li><li>Rename the .dmp file to Adempiere.dmp for Oracle and Adempiere_pg.dmp for Postgres. Do the same for the log file.</li><li>Jar the .dmp and log file to into Adempiere.jar or Adempiere_pg.jar.</li><li>Execute RUN_ImportAdempiere.[sh|bat] and verify that the database loads without error.</li><li>Start the client and verify that there are no errors or warnings about database/software version differences.</li><li>Repeat the process with the other database. Hopefully, there will be no errors, otherwise, you&#39;ll have to fix them and redo the first database.</li><li>Copy the new seed files to the repository adempiere/data/seed directory, replacing the files that are there.</li><li>Commit the new seed files and any corrections that were made to the xml or code.</li>",18),d=(0,i.IL)('<p>In summary:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>RUN_ImportAdempiere\nRUN_MigrateXML\nRUN_DBExport\n</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><h3 id="previous-to-3-8-0-applying-sql-migration-files" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#previous-to-3-8-0-applying-sql-migration-files" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Previous to 3.8.0 Applying SQL Migration Files</h3><p>Prior to release 3.8.0, the migrations were applied by SQL files which can be applied in a number of ways.
