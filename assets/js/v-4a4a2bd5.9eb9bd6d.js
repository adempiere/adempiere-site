The work is ready for review.\n[06:21:49] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Hi Mike, that is welcome news .. thanks.\n[06:22:40] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Konstantin, would you like to start with any info about reviews\n[06:22:42] Mario Calderón: hi Mike!\n\nI saw you did the commits\n[06:23:19] Mario Calderón: can I ask Victor to include it so we can review it?\n[06:23:58] Michael McKay: Yes.  I need to integrate with the release candidate and can commit the integrated branch.  It will be easier to combine with the release branch.\n[06:25:40] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Mike, am I correct in assuming this will allow us to see it in Suman&#39;s demo system?\n[06:26:19] suman ravuri: @Michael, are you commiiting in 38orcs directly?\n[06:26:26] suman ravuri: sorry 380rc1\n[06:27:32] Michael McKay: No.  I&#39;m integrating 380rc1 with feature/ADEMPIERE-72 and will test before adding to rc1.  Don&#39;t want to screw up any of your work.\n[06:27:40] suman ravuri: ok thanks\n[06:29:02] Konstantin Herold: @Steve I don&#39;t really have any infos on reviews. Last week I tried to do a functional review for Walkingtree&#39;s Human resources, but I couldn&#39;t find any documentation.\n[06:29:37] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): @Suman, any suggestions to help Konstantin?\n[06:30:02] suman ravuri: @Konstatin, documentation is yet to evloved\n[06:30:15] suman ravuri: I would be able to walk you through once\n[06:30:24] suman ravuri: with HR features\n[06:30:41] suman ravuri: does it work for you?\n[06:30:56] Mario Calderón: @Suman: Enrique and me also wanted to do the same as Harold\n[06:32:28] suman ravuri: @Mario, We started documentation and but it is still in early stages\n[06:32:44] suman ravuri: walkthough of functionality would be ok?\n[06:32:58] Mario Calderón: yes!!!\n\nthis would be enough\n[06:33:08] Mario Calderón: we can from then review\n[06:33:16] suman ravuri: once this meeting is over we decide the suitable time\n[06:33:21] suman ravuri: we can walkthough once\n[06:33:24] Mario Calderón: ok\n[06:34:06] Konstantin Herold: @suman: ok\n[06:34:15] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Just to be clear .. are we going to include functionality that may be good even if there is no documentation so other possible users can understand it?\n[06:34:40] Mario Calderón: we are going to review it\n[06:35:10] Mario Calderón: while we are reviewing, Walking Tree will complete the documentation, so I understood Suman\n[06:35:36] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Suman, what is the documentation plan please?\n[06:35:42] Mario Calderón: (we don&#39;t need the 100% documentation to review)\n[06:36:37] suman ravuri: We don&#39;t have a plan at this point of time to complete documentation. I need to revisit the decision, I will be able to communicate date after review of resource plan\n[06:38:03] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): thanks .. I am sure the review is a good idea.  my concern is the same as with payroll, I would like to be able to use it but I can not understand how it works ..\n[06:38:46] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): without documentation it is of limited value (in my view) .. perhaps others think differently? comments?\n[06:40:09] suman ravuri: Mario and others will be able to comments once they review with me together\n[06:40:18] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok\n[06:40:29] Mario Calderón: @Suman: there is no need a complete documentation, but a page summarizing it, like http://www.adempiere.com/index.php?title=Libero_Human_Resource_%26_Payroll_Official_Extension , or less.\n\n\n\nIf we have a walkthrough, Enrique, John and me can complete the documentation page.\n[06:40:51] Mario Calderón: and Harold, for sure\n[06:40:56] suman ravuri: ok\n[06:41:23] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): next item?  &quot;it was decided that Metas had the task of integrating all its contributions into the instance they rolled out http://144.76.112.17:8080/webui/index.zul&quot;\n[06:41:29] Yamel Senih: Hi all\n[06:41:35] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): can anyone report on the status of this item?\n[06:42:05] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Hi Yamel..\n[06:42:23] Mario Calderón: hi Yamel\n[06:43:39] Mario Calderón: only Cristina and Herold are from Metas; actually it is Tobi who knows exactly about it, because he&#39;s the one in charge of doing it...\n[06:44:44] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Cristina, Harold .. have you heard anything from Tobi on this?\n[06:45:40] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I guess not, perhaps we hear more later.\n[06:46:55] Konstantin Herold: Tobi created a branch and started integrating but noticed that some modifications need to be done.\n[06:47:23] Konstantin Herold: hopefully we can manage to finish this next week\n[06:48:06] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): does this mean before the next meeting or the following one?\n[06:48:21] Konstantin Herold: following one\n[06:48:32] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok\n[06:48:38] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): thanks\n[06:48:51] Konstantin Herold: (btw. its &quot;Herold&quot; with an &quot;e&quot; ;) )\n[06:50:21] Mario Calderón: @Herold: copied ;)\n[06:50:26] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): thanks for correction .. I was following Mario!\n[06:50:48] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Mario, is there a plan to follow up on the testing as outlined in your update to the Contributions Summary page?\n[06:51:58] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): or we are just hoping people will pick a part of the work and do it?\n[06:52:55] Mario Calderón: @Steven: people should pick up and review\n[06:53:13] Mario Calderón: there are some pending...\n\nmostly technically\n[06:54:41] Mario Calderón: functionally is almost everything from Adaxa and eEvolution review.\n\nWhen Metas publishes code and function, we&#39;d be almost done\n[06:55:09] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok .. and of course the WT HR review..\n[06:55:11] Mario Calderón: (the ominous Cost Engine is waiting)\n[06:55:48] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): thank you for that reminder :-(\n[06:56:44] Mario Calderón: Susanne tested it for satandard , average and last invoice\n\nshe had to do some changes, and you have to covince Victor to adopt them\n[06:57:02] Mario Calderón: then, it can be included\n[06:57:57] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok .. will try to follow up with Victor, he may have made some of the cnages we suggested already but I have not tried to re-test\n[06:58:09] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Can we move on to next section...\n[06:58:10] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Actions taken by RM\n[06:58:14] suman ravuri: \n\n1. Mobile UI is integrated. Testing completed. Will be deployed in walkingtree env by EOD today\n\n2. Ware house manaement integrated, Under testing\n\n3. Forecast management - waiting for input from Victor on missing files\n[06:59:40] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): thanks .. what will follow after that?\n[07:00:00] suman ravuri: HR manament and MFG\n[07:00:38] suman ravuri: but for MFG Victor has to update the code as per package suggested by teo\n[07:00:41] suman ravuri: he is working on it\n[07:01:04] suman ravuri: can I start manufacturing lite?\n[07:01:39] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I expect so .. its in production use and there is some documentation.\n[07:01:49] suman ravuri: ok\n[07:02:00] suman ravuri: lite and MFG can co exist?\n[07:02:15] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): main issue as mentioned before is whether to use the old BOM tables that it presently uses of invest the effort to adopt the same as Victor&#39;s\n[07:03:02] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I think they co-exist.. they do in the version that is in the Adaxa branch on sourceforge\n[07:03:34] suman ravuri: ok\n[07:03:35] Mario Calderón: @Steven: this is also my  opinion. Of course, later on sb can integrate them\n[07:03:55] suman ravuri: sb means?\n[07:04:06] Mario Calderón: somebody\n[07:04:13] suman ravuri: ok\n[07:04:15] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): oh .. him!\n[07:04:34] Mario Calderón: the culprit\n[07:04:43] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): so, we go forward with the old BOM tables then?\n[07:05:46] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): the impact is mainly that a single parent product can only have a single set of chold products and services to make it .. one of the reasons it is called &quot;Light&quot;\n[07:06:16] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): the newer BOM tables let you have multiple BOMs for same end product.\n[07:06:32] suman ravuri: can on product be child of multiple prodcuts?\n[07:06:43] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): yes\n[07:07:12] suman ravuri: if product has muliple BOMs,user will have choice to choose?\n[07:07:32] suman ravuri: at appropriate place based on the need?\n[07:09:17] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): if we have an m_product with a BOM that says qty 2 m_product &quot;A&quot; and qty 3 m_product &quot;B&quot; then you cant also make it from qty 2 m_product &quot;A&quot; and qty 3 m_product &quot;XX&quot;\n[07:10:37] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): so it also restricts you from having a current production BOM formula and another one fro engineering development etc .. a single made product can only have a single set of child products at any one time\n[07:10:51] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): does that answer the question?\n[07:11:08] suman ravuri: yes\n[07:11:26] suman ravuri: my suggestion would be to go with single BOM for product to make it simple\n[07:11:50] suman ravuri: but migration would be tricky if some one want to migrate from lite to MFG\n[07:11:54] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): .. but note that you can substitute in child product XX after you created the Production Lines\n[07:12:47] suman ravuri: @Mario, any suggestions?\n[07:12:50] suman ravuri: ok\n[07:13:14] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I don&#39;t understand the newer BOM table structure but if migrating you should only have a 1:1 relationship in the source data so I am guessing it would not be that complex.\n[07:13:26] Mario Calderón: as I said, it is OK\n\n&quot;somebody&quot; can integrate in the future Libero and Light\n[07:13:50] Mario Calderón: not  a big deal, I suppose\n[07:13:50] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok .. so Suman starts integrating?\n[07:13:56] Mario Calderón: yes!\n[07:13:58] suman ravuri: ok\n[07:14:02] suman ravuri: fine with it\n[07:14:09] Mario Calderón: ..and the rest of the items\n[07:14:22] suman ravuri: I will get this done this week\n[07:14:28] Mario Calderón: well, I&#39;ve just seen a couple of them while we were talking\n[07:14:43] Mario Calderón: that suman committed\n[07:14:59] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): what is left for Suman to do that has passed functional and technical review already?\n[07:15:22] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): other than the items mentioned above\n[07:15:34] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Suman?\n[07:15:45] suman ravuri: one minute\n[07:16:55] suman ravuri: Add Export Account Viewer\n\nNew grouping for product\n\nMRP Supply and Demand Pegging\n\nMRP Browse for demand and supply\n\nNet Change Material Plan and Selective Material Plant\n\nSmart Browse for approval of Planning Order\n[07:17:14] suman ravuri: these are all there reviewed by mario technically and functionally\n[07:18:19] suman ravuri: many of them arel based on MFG if I understand correctly so MFG integration will be priority\n[07:19:01] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): that sounds like a large piece of work .. and then after you are dependent on the rest of us completing reviews?\n[07:19:49] suman ravuri: yes\n[07:20:07] Mario Calderón: we can call the teams to complete the reviews\n[07:21:31] Mario Calderón: WT&#39;s contributions...\n\nMetas...\n\nmissing eEvolution&#39;s and Adaxa&#39;s..\n[07:23:11] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I think we shopuld follow those items up after the meeting .. people ok with that?\n[07:23:29] Mario Calderón: ok\n[07:23:54] suman ravuri: ok\n[07:24:09] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Technical team reviews\n\nFunctional Team reviews\n[07:24:49] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Nothing to report this week?\n[07:25:12] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok...\n[07:25:13] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Actions to be taken\n[07:25:39] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Adaxa ... more work on costing review..\n[07:26:09] Mario Calderón: I will take on some technical reviews still open so suman can integrate them\n[07:26:39] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Mario, u mentioned above something that is outstanding from adaxa .. what was it please.\n[07:27:09] Mario Calderón: ..mmh don&#39;t remeber well right now\n\nI can have a look and tell you?\n[07:27:14] Mario Calderón: should we set up a date to be finished with reviews, so that we publish it to the community to test?\n\n\n\nThe resting contributions (WT&#39;s, Metas, costin Engine) can still be included in the meantimen\n[07:28:31] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Can we take that as an action for next meeting and get an up-to-date view on what is required into the hands of the people we hope will do it? .. before that meeting\n[07:29:04] Mario Calderón: I&#39;d like to, so we can publish a date\n[07:29:37] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Next Meeting?\n[07:29:59] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): same time next Monday?\n[07:30:14] Mario Calderón: +1\n[07:31:12] suman ravuri: @Steve, I have request here\n[07:31:23] suman ravuri: can we make it tuesday every week?\n[07:31:54] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I am ok with Tuesday .. what do others want?\n[07:32:43] Mario Calderón: for me, NP\n\nbut it would be good to hear other opinions\n\nwe should ask in the mailing list...\n[07:32:59] suman ravuri: can I initiate thread?\n[07:33:07] Mario Calderón: yes Suman, do it\n[07:33:11] suman ravuri: ok thanks\n[07:33:25] suman ravuri: will do that based on response we can finalize it\n[07:33:49] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok .. next Tuesday unless others raise objections before then.\n[07:34:10] Mario Calderón: bye to all and have a nice day!\n[07:34:24] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Mario .. as you send minutes so quick p[erhaps you can just highlight this change at start of minutes?\n[07:34:27] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): bye\n[07:34:54] suman ravuri: bye\n[07:35:24] Mario Calderón: I will do the minutes today\n\nin a couple of hours I will
