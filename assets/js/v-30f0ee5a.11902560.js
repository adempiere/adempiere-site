I guess we must also have the benefit of the knowledge of people who are using it in production.. does anyone know hpw many are using it?\n[07:15:33] Enrique Ruibal: I know Victor has several customers using it\n[07:15:52] Mario Calderón: I have 3 customers\n[07:16:36] Victor Perez Juarez: about the cash flow , Susanne can give some references\n[07:17:00] Victor Perez Juarez: She install and have with some customer , even She send me some patches\n[07:17:40] suman ravuri: ok\n[07:18:00] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): can we finish with payroll and then go to cashflow management\n[07:18:07] suman ravuri: ok\n[07:18:09] suman ravuri: agree\n[07:18:27] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I read &quot;The module is more tool-kit than a ready-to-use module. This means, the implementors have to develop everything.\n\nThe module enables to manage complex payroll scenarios/situations.\n\nDownside: the module offers all possibilities, but you have to do it by yourself. There is no solution for a specific country.&quot;\n[07:19:19] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): Is this just an unavoidable problem for a system that has too work in many jurisdictions?\n[07:19:33] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): and therefore unavoidable?\n[07:19:37] Mario Calderón: @Steven: yes, like taxes\n[07:20:27] suman ravuri: I have implemented in for one the customer\n[07:20:45] suman ravuri: it is not ready for non technical people\n[07:20:52] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I have looked at it a number of times and decided it was too difficult for a non-technical person to understand .. and I have been paying people for 35 years\n[07:21:21] Mario Calderón: once you&#39;ve done it for one country, you can do it for all companies of this country.\n\n\n\nId. suggest do do a repository for evey country, like the tax &quot;localizations&quot; from Colombia or Brasil\n[07:21:24] suman ravuri: it still expects people to understand some sort of scripting\n[07:21:50] Mario Calderón: @Steven: the scripting is the key\n[07:22:02] Enrique Ruibal: I think an experienced payroll user will manage to make it work.\n[07:22:17] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): maybe a template system for one or two existing jurisdictions would let people understand it more quickly?\n[07:22:26] Enrique Ruibal: people using other payroll systems will be capable to customize it\n[07:22:48] Mario Calderón: @Steven: good idea. We can see to bring one solution into seed.\n[07:23:18] suman ravuri: in http://eaglerp.walkingtree.in/admin, we wrote all those scripts and made it ready to use\n[07:23:33] suman ravuri: some one can look at it let us know if this can be used\n[07:23:38] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): @Enrique ... tht was my point, I have been &quot;using&quot; payroll systems for 35 years and I cant understand it\n[07:23:40] suman ravuri: this is based on payrol module\n[07:23:48] Mario Calderón: @Suman: great! this can be broufht into seed, then\n[07:23:49] Cristina Ghita: Yes, as example\n\nANd with a good tranining, I think, in the end, also a non-techincla person would be able to write rules\n[07:24:09] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): if by &quot;using&quot; you mean implementing and developing .. weel thats different.\n[07:24:21] Cristina Ghita: @Steven: because it allowes you to configure everything\n[07:24:42] suman ravuri: implementing existing payroll module\n[07:25:11] Cristina Ghita: so, I guess we need in the seed an implementation for a country.. or some basic rules already written\n[07:25:32] suman ravuri: @Mario, I would like some one form FT to review and let us know if it is meeting all required standards\n[07:26:10] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): @Cristina .. I understood the flexibility which is essential for ADempiere .. I just could not make it work without a technical person doing most of the work ... but with a working system even if it was working to different rules I think I could come to understand its way of working\n[07:26:18] Enrique Ruibal: @Steven perhaps I am thinking of payroll systems in Mexico, they relate to what Victor developed\n[07:26:26] Cristina Ghita: Yes, agree!\n[07:26:47] Cristina Ghita: We need  an example in the seed\n[07:27:33] Mario Calderón: so what about including HR/Payroll the same way as Libero Manufacturing?\n[07:27:42] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): do I need to learn Spanish ;-)\n[07:28:02] Victor Perez Juarez: I have manual in english\n[07:28:11] Victor Perez Juarez: http://team.e-evolution.com/share\n[07:28:14] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): thanks..\n[07:28:17] Victor Perez Juarez: please use adempiere\n[07:28:18] Victor Perez Juarez: adempiere\n[07:28:22] Victor Perez Juarez: here the manual\n[07:29:10] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): it would be really great to have a payroll solution.. I will try harder.\n[07:29:46] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): @Victor, it wants a user and pw\n[07:30:23] Mario Calderón: can we move on faster? Ihave to leave in 20 mins.\n[07:30:43] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): ok .. move on ..

but since it&#39;s not up to us, what solutions we have for this?\n[07:46:42] Enrique Ruibal: after the release we should discuss other options...\n[07:47:26] Enrique Ruibal: to be honest is so much easier to participate in google groups than in source forge discussion forums\n[07:48:20] Cristina Ghita: because when a new user comes, I don&#39;t know how will clone the adempiere repo.. if he has

hours\n[07:51:32] suman ravuri: in any problem in middle need to try from first\n[07:52:01] Mario Calderón: it is almost 1GB\n[07:52:37] Enrique Ruibal: even with that size if you clone something on say bitbucket is is so much faster\n[07:54:17] Steven Sackett (Adaxa): I have to leave the meeting .. good night/day to all..\n[07:54:29] Cristina Ghita: bye\n[07:54:46] Cristina Ghita: I would
