Throughout this time the group of developers has experienced the increasing complexity of managing this project as a mission-critical software development endeavour.</p><p>This process has been occasionally not only complex but also tedious, since the philosophy of our project is based on the Bazaar approach, that expects many contributors with different profiles, experience and ways of thinking. So the big question is: how to manage the project with all these contributors?</p><p>On the one hand we have contributors (aka committers) with great experience in the project. They want to and often do contribute with new features, generating a dynamic line of development. Many of these new features can be brought to our committee for approval and inclusion in the main develop branch.</p><p>This process is very important because it lets us review and evaluate new features by experts both technical and functional.</p><p>Another important aspect is the incredible ability of contributors to create new features, usually beginning with a creative idea that evolves and matures. After this has happened, the contributor wishes to show his deeds to others to receive feedback and eventually to submit for trial.</p><p>The new features can be fully completed or in progress, but it is important to establish a policy of sharing functionality in order to evaluate the pros and cons of the feature.</p><p>The process nowadays is complex because there aren&#39;t tools and procedures enabling dynamic collaboration. As a consequence of that, the project may be or seem to be stalled or still worse, these new features are never included within the main trunk, limiting the creativity and innovation of the project.</p><p>On the other hand there are contributors who discover a problem/bug in the program. They create a solution to the problem in their private repository. In many cases, many of these bug fixes do not land in the main line of code.</p><p>Why? In my opinion, it is because of the lack of tools and of a process that explains how to share, how to facilitate collaboration, reviews and evaluation of bug fixes in a simple way.</p><p>Another aspect of our software development concerns the release of new versions that include bug fixes as well as new features are approved by the project committees. In the current approach, the main line of code must be frozen during the release process. This simplifies the process for the technical equipment, but has the disadvantage of stopping the momentum of a Bazaar-like project like ours, which is in constant evolution.</p><p>The release process also involves steps towards maintaining already released versions. These versions are not fault-free and so it is possible to find errors anew. Thus the versioning process is an additional task for the technical team, and using a tool to facilitate the creation of a service pack becomes a key factor.</p><p>Once the major issues were pinpointed, the technical committee analyzed and improved the current development process. As a result of this, changes were made in the current procedure in order to solve the current problems and thus improve collaboration in the project.</p><p>kind regards</p>',14),u={href:"https://wiki.adempiere.net/User:Vpj-cd",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},p=(0,i.Uk)("Victor Pérez"),m=(0,i.uE)('<p>Member of Technical Team</p><h2 id="goals" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#goals" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Goals</h2><p>This document is about establishing processes, rules and teams to achieve the following:</p><ul><li>Produce high quality ERP software</li><li>Regular and scheduled releases</li><li>An all-time stable “<strong>master</strong>” branch</li><li>Explicit and concise rules how to manage the ADempiere Code Repository</li><li>Reduce overhead caused by reverts for unfinished features</li><li>Documentation for all new features</li><li>Teams are to be responsible not single persons</li><li>Lean project organisation</li><li>Continuous and reliable progress</li><li>Increase collaboration among developers</li><li>Facilitate the task of project management</li></ul><h2 id="glossary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#glossary" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Glossary</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Main branch</strong></p><ul><li><strong>master</strong> Branch (before: stable) <ul><li>Only for release and hotfixes approved</li><li>An infinite lifetime</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>develop Branch</strong> (before: development)</p><ul><li>Main line of code</li><li>An infinite lifetime</li><li>Never freezes.</li><li>Gets voted and approved commits from features branches.</li><li>No experiments</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Support Branches</strong> (before directly in trunk)</p><ul><li><strong>Release</strong></li><li><strong>Feature</strong></li><li><strong>Hot Fixes</strong></li><li>These branches always have a limited life time</li><li>Since they will be removed eventually.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src="/assets/img/community/preface/software-development/1200px-ADempiere_Repository_Structure.png" alt="ADempiere_Repository_Structure"></p><h2 id="software-production-cycle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#software-production-cycle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Software Production Cycle</h2><p><strong>Development Phase (3 Months)</strong></p><ul><li>“develop” branch which is the main line of development.</li><li>New functionalities are implemented in separate “feature” branches with the aim to get them into develop branch <ul><li>Developers have 3 months time for integrating new functionalities, changes, Bug fixing and Integration testing in their branch</li><li>Before integrating new/ changed Functionality in &quot;develop&quot; the Developers/ Implementers have to apply for approval by Technical and Functional Team</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Stabilization Phase (1 month)</strong></p><ul><li>After development phase is over there is one month stabilization phase where the “release” branch is created and frozen for new features.

Some would call this the “integration branch”. This is where any automatic nightly builds are built from.</p><p>When the source code in the <strong>develop</strong> branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all of the changes should be merged back into <strong>master</strong> somehow and then tagged with a release number. How this is done in detail will be discussed further on.</p><p>Therefore, each time when changes are merged back into <strong>master</strong>, this is a new production release by definition. We tend to be very strict at this, so that theoretically, we could use a script to automatically build and roll-out our software to our production servers everytime there was a commit on <strong>master</strong>.</p><h2 id="supporting-branches" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#supporting-branches" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Supporting branches</h2><p>Next to the <strong>main</strong> branches master and <strong>develop</strong>, our development model uses a variety of supporting branches to aid parallel development between team members, ease tracking of features, prepare for production releases and to assist in quickly fixing live production problems. Unlike the main branches, these branches always have a limited life time, since they will be removed eventually. The different types of branches we may use are:</p><ul><li>Feature branches</li><li>Release branches</li><li>Hotfix branches</li></ul><p>Each of these branches have a specific purpose and are bound to strict rules as to which branches may be their originating branch and which branches must be their merge targets. We will walk through them in a minute.</p><p>By no means are these branches “special” from a technical perspective. The branch types are categorized by how we use them. They are of course plain old Mercurial branches.</p><h3 id="feature-branches" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#feature-branches" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Feature branches</h3><ul><li>May branch off from: <strong>develop</strong></li><li>Must merge back into: <strong>develop</strong></li></ul><p>Branch naming convention: anything except master, develop,release-<em>, or hotfix-</em></p><p>Feature branches (or sometimes called topic branches) are used to development new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. When starting development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will be incorporated may well be unknown at that point. The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into <strong>develop</strong> (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).</p><p>Feature branches typically exist in developer repository only, not in origin.</p><h4 id="creating-a-feature-branch" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-feature-branch" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Creating a feature branch</h4><h5 id="incorporating-a-finished-feature-on-develop" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#incorporating-a-finished-feature-on-develop" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Incorporating a finished feature on develop</h5><p>Finished features may be merged into the <strong>develop</strong> branch definitely add them to the upcoming release.</p><h5 id="release-branches" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#release-branches" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Release branches</h5><ul><li>May branch off from: develop</li><li>Must merge back into: develop and master&#39;</li><li>Branch naming convention: release-*</li></ul><p>Release branches support preparation of a new production release. They allow for last-minute dotting of i’s and crossing t’s. Furthermore, they allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release (version number, build dates, etc.). By doing all of this work on a release branch, the development branch is cleared to receive features for the next big release.</p><p>The key moment to branch off a new release branch from develop is when development (almost) reflects the desired state of the new release. At least all features that are targeted for the release-to-be-built must be merged in to develop at this point in time. All features targeted at future releases may not—they must wait until after the release branch is branched off.</p><p>It is exactly at the start of a release branch that the upcoming release gets assigned a version number—not any earlier. Up until that moment, the development branch reflected changes for the “next release”, but it is unclear whether that “next release” will eventually become 3.6 or 4.0, until the release branch is started. That decision is made on the start of the release branch and is carried out by the project’s rules on version number bumping.</p><h5 id="creating-a-release-branch" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-release-branch" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Creating a release branch</h5><p>Release branches are created from the develop branch. For example, say version 1.1.5 is the current production release and we have a big release coming up. The state of develop is ready for the “next release” and we have decided that this will become version 1.2 (rather than 1.1.6 or 2.0). So we branch off and give the release branch a name reflecting the new version number.</p><p>After creating a new branch and switching to it, we bump the version number. Here, bump-version.sh is a fictional shell script that changes some files in the working copy to reflect the new version. (This can of course be a manual change—the point being that some files change.) Then, the bumped version number is committed.</p><p>This new branch may exist there for a while, until the release may be rolled out definitely. During that time, bug fixes may be applied in this branch (rather than on the develop branch). Adding large new features here is strictly prohibited. They must be merged into develop, and therefore, wait for the next big release.</p><h5 id="finishing-a-release-branch" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#finishing-a-release-branch" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Finishing a release branch</h5><p>When the state of the release branch is ready to become a real release, some actions need to be carried out. First, the release branch is merged into master (since every commit on master is a new release by definition, remember). Next, that commit on master must be tagged for easy future reference to this historical version. Finally, the changes made on the release branch need to be merged back into development, so that future releases also contain these bug fixes.</p><p>Now we are really done and the release branch may be removed, since we don’t need it anymore:</p><h5 id="hotfix-branches" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hotfix-branches" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Hotfix branches</h5><p>Hotfix branches are created from the master branch. For example, say version 1.2 is the current production release running live and causing troubles due to a severe bug. But changes on develop are yet in process. We may then branch off a hotfix branch and start fixing the problem.</p><p>Don’t forget to bump the version number after branching off! Then, fix the bug and commit the fix in one or more separate commits.</p><h5 id="finishing-a-hotfix-branch" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#finishing-a-hotfix-branch" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Finishing a hotfix branch</h5><p>When finished, the bugfix needs to be merged back into master, but also needs to be merged back into develop, in order to safeguard that the bugfix is included in the next release as well. This is completely similar to how release branches are finished. First, update master and tag the release.</p><p>The one exception to the rule here is that, when a release branch currently exists, the hotfix changes need to be merged into that release branch, instead of &#39;develop branch.</p><p>Back-merging the bugfix into the release branch will eventually result in the bugfix being merged into develop too, when the release branch is finished.
